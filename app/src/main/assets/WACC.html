    <h2>What is WACC?</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is an important metric used by companies when
        deciding whether or not an investment opportunity is worth pursuing.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>WACC is calculated by weighting each component (debt or equity) by its respective cost
        (interest rate or required return) based on its proportionate share in total capital.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC Formula</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>The formula for calculating WACC is:</p>  <!-- Add your own formulas here -->
    <formula>WACC = (D / V) * rd + (E / V) * k</formula>  <!-- Add your own formulas here -->
    <p>In this formula:</p>  <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <ul>  <!-- Add your own lists here -->
        <li>D = Market value (or book value) for all outstanding debt</li>
        <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>V = Market value (or book value) for all outstanding debt and equity</li>
        <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>rd = Interest rate on outstanding debt</li>  <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>E = Market value (or book value) for all outstanding equity</li>
        <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>k = Required return (or cost of equity) for outstanding equity</li>
        <!-- Add your own list items here -->
    </ul>  <!-- Add your own lists here -->
    <h2>Why is WACC Important?</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>WACC is important because it represents the true cost of capital for a company. By using
        WACC, a company can determine whether a proposed investment opportunity is worth pursuing,
        as it takes into account the cost of capital for each source of financing.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>WACC is also important because it helps a company determine the appropriate mix of debt and
        equity financing. By adjusting the proportion of debt and equity in its capital structure, a
        company can lower its WACC and make its capital more attractive to investors.</p>

    <h2>Examples of WACC</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>Here's an example of how to calculate WACC:</p>  <!-- Add your own examples here -->
    <example>
        Assume a company has $10 million in debt outstanding at an interest rate of 6%, and $20
        million in equity outstanding with a required return of 12%. The company's WACC would be:

        WACC = (D / V) * rd + (E / V) * k
        WACC = ($10 million / $30 million) * 0.06 + ($20 million / $30 million) * 0.12
        WACC = 0.04 + 0.08
        WACC = 0.12 (12%)
    </example>  <!-- Add your own examples here -->
    <h2>Factors Affecting WACC</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>There are several factors that can affect a company's WACC:</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <ul>  <!-- Add your own lists here -->
        <li>Interest rates: Higher interest rates on debt will increase the cost of debt and,
            therefore, increase WACC.
        </li>  <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>Required returns on equity: Higher required returns on equity will increase the cost of
            equity and, therefore, increase WACC.
        </li>  <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>Proportion of debt and equity: A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital
            structure will increase WACC, while a higher proportion of equity will decrease WACC.
        </li>  <!-- Add your own list items here -->
        <li>Tax rate: A lower tax rate will decrease the after-tax cost of debt and, therefore,
            decrease WACC.
        </li>  <!-- Add your own list items here -->
    </ul>  <!-- Add your own lists here -->
    <h2>WACC and Capital Structure</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>A company's capital structure is the mix of debt and equity financing it uses to finance its
        operations. The optimal capital structure for a company will depend on several factors,
        including its industry, risk profile, and tax rate.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>In general, a company should strive to maintain a capital structure that minimizes its WACC.
        This can be achieved by balancing the tax benefits of debt financing with the higher
        required returns of equity financing.</p>  <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC and Leverage</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>Leverage refers to the use of debt financing to increase a company's return on equity (ROE).
        While leverage can increase ROE, it can also increase WACC and, therefore, make capital less
        attractive to investors.</p>  <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>In general, a company should strive to maintain a level of leverage that balances the
        benefits of increased ROE with the increased cost of capital.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC and Capital Budgeting</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>Capital budgeting refers to the process of evaluating and selecting capital investment
        projects. When evaluating a capital investment project, a company should consider the
        project's impact on WACC.</p>  <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>If a capital investment project will increase WACC, it may not be worth pursuing, as it will
        increase the cost of capital for the company as a whole.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC and Risk Management</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>Risk management refers to the process of identifying, assessing, and managing risks that
        could affect a company's operations and financial performance.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>When managing risks, a company should consider the impact on WACC. For example, a company may
        choose to increase its debt financing to reduce the cost of capital, but it should also
        consider the increased risk associated with higher levels of debt.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC and Financial Analysis</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>WACC is an important metric for financial analysis, as it provides insight into a company's
        cost of capital and the appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>When analyzing a company's financial performance, investors should consider the company's
        WACC and how it compares to other companies in its industry.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <h2>WACC and Financial Planning</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>WACC is also important for financial planning, as it helps a company determine the
        appropriate level of debt and equity financing to maintain a balanced capital structure.</p>
    <!-- Add your own paragraphs here -->
    <p>When developing a financial plan, a company should consider its WACC and how it will impact
        the cost of capital for future investment opportunities.</p>

    <h2>WACC and Financial Strategy</h2>  <!-- Add your own subheadings here -->
    <p>WACC is a key component of a company's financial strategy, as it helps the company determine
