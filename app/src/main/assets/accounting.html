    <h4>What is Accounting?</h4>
    <p>Accounting involves recording financial transactions related to a business. This process
        includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies,
        regulators, and tax authorities. Financial statements in accounting provide a brief overview
        of a company's financial activities during a specific period, outlining its operations,
        financial position, and cash flows.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounting is crucial for decision-making, cost planning, and assessing economic
            performance, regardless of a business's size.
        </li>
        <li>While a bookkeeper can manage basic accounting tasks, larger or more complex tasks may
            require the expertise of a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).
        </li>
        <li>Managerial accounting aids management in making business decisions, while cost
            accounting helps determine product costs.
        </li>
        <li>Professional accountants adhere to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
            when preparing financial statements.
        </li>
        <li>Accounting plays a vital role in strategic planning, regulatory compliance, fundraising,
            and operational management.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Exploring the Various Forms of Accounting</h3>
    <p>Accountants are often tasked with documenting specific transactions or dealing with
        particular sets of data. As a result, accountants can generally be categorized into several
        broad groups.</p>
    <article>
        <h3>Financial Accounting</h3>
        <p>Financial accounting involves the procedures used to produce interim and annual financial
            statements. The outcomes of all financial transactions that take place during an
            accounting period are summarized in the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow
            statement. Most companies’ financial statements are audited annually by an external CPA
            firm.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Managerial Accounting</h3>
        <p>Managerial accounting utilizes much of the same data as financial accounting, but it
            organizes and uses information differently. Specifically, in managerial accounting, an
            accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business’s management team can
            use to make operational decisions. Managerial accounting also includes many other
            aspects of accounting, such as budgeting, forecasting, and various financial analysis
            tools. Essentially, any information that may be beneficial to management falls under
            this category.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Cost Accounting</h3>
        <p>Just as managerial accounting aids businesses in making management decisions, cost
            accounting assists businesses in making costing decisions. Essentially, cost accounting
            takes into account all of the costs associated with producing a product. Analysts,
            managers, business owners, and accountants use this information to determine the cost of
            their products. In cost accounting, money is viewed as an economic factor in production,
            whereas in financial accounting, money is seen as a measure of a company’s economic
            performance.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>Tax Accounting</h3>
        <p>While financial accountants often use one set of rules to report a company’s financial
            position, tax accountants often use a different set of rules. These rules are
            established at the federal, state, or local level depending on the return being filed.
            Tax accounts balance compliance with reporting rules while also attempting to minimize a
            company’s tax liability through thoughtful strategic decision-making. A tax accountant
            often oversees the entire tax process of a company: the strategic creation of the
            organization chart, the operations, the compliance, the reporting, and the remittance of
            tax liability.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Accounting Equation - What is the Accounting Equation?</h3>
    <p>The accounting equation is a fundamental principle of double-entry accounting. It is used to
        represent the relationship between a company's assets, liabilities, and equity. The equation
        is expressed as:</p>
    <p><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assets:</strong> These are the economic resources owned by the company, which
            can be tangible or intangible. Examples include cash, inventory, property, equipment,
            and accounts receivable.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> These are the company's obligations or debts to external
            parties. Liabilities include loans, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and mortgages.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Also known as net worth or shareholders' equity, equity
            represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting
            liabilities. It is the owner's claim on the company's assets and is calculated as: <br>
            <p><strong>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The accounting equation must always balance, meaning that the total value of assets must
        equal the total value of liabilities and equity. This principle ensures that every
        transaction recorded in the accounting system maintains the balance between the two sides of
        the equation.</p>
    <p>Changes in one element of the equation will affect the other elements. For example, if a
        company takes out a loan (increasing liabilities), it will also have more cash (increasing
        assets). Similarly, if a company sells goods for cash, it will increase both cash (an asset)
        and equity (retained earnings).</p>
    <p>The accounting equation is the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping, where every
        transaction affects at least two accounts and maintains the equation's balance.
        Understanding the accounting equation is essential for financial analysis, decision-making,
        and preparing financial statements.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Example of the Accounting Equation</h3>
    <p>Let's illustrate the accounting equation with a simple example:</p>
    <p>Company XYZ has the following financial information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Assets: ₱100,000</li>
        <li>Total Liabilities: ₱60,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using the accounting equation, we can calculate the equity as follows:</p>
    <p>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</p>
    <p>Equity = ₱100,000 - ₱60,000</p>
    <p>Equity = ₱40,000</p>
    <p>So, the equity of Company XYZ is ₱40,000.</p>

<section class="article-section">
    <h3 class="sub-heading">T-Account - What is a T-Account?</h3>
    <p>A T-account is a graphical representation of a general ledger account. It gets its name from
        the T shape formed by its vertical and horizontal lines. The left side of the "T" represents
        debit entries, while the right side represents credit entries.</p>
    <p>T-accounts are commonly used by bookkeepers and accountants to track the flow of transactions
        through individual accounts within the general ledger. Each account in the ledger has its
        own T-account, allowing for a clear and organized record of transactions.</p>
    <p>Here's how a T-account is typically structured:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The left side (debit side) is used to record increases in assets and expenses or
            decreases in liabilities and equity.
        </li>
        <li>The right side (credit side) is used to record decreases in assets and expenses or
            increases in liabilities and equity.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using T-accounts, accountants can easily see the effect of each transaction on the balance
        of specific accounts. This visual representation helps ensure accuracy and consistency in
        recording financial data.</p>
    <p>T-accounts are also useful for preparing trial balances and financial statements, as they
        provide a clear summary of account balances at any given time.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Example of a T-Account</h3>
    <p>Let's consider an example of a T-account for the "Cash" account:</p>
    <table style="border: 1px solid #333; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 15px auto;">
        <tr>
            <th style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Date</th>

            <th style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Debit</th>
            <th style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Credit</th>
            <th style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Balance</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Jan 1</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Initial balance</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$10,000</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;"></td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$10,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Jan 5</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Received cash from sales</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;"></td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$5,000</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$15,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Jan 10</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Paid rent</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$2,000</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;"></td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$13,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Jan 15</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">Received cash from a loan</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;"></td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$8,000</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid #333; padding: 8px;">$21,000</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In this example, the left side (debit) represents increases in the cash account, while the
        right side (credit) represents decreases. The balance column shows the running balance of
        the cash account after each transaction.</p>


    <h3 class="sub-heading">Advantages of T-Accounts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> T-accounts provide a clear visual representation of individual
            account balances, making it easier for bookkeepers and accountants to understand and
            analyze financial transactions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> By organizing transactions into debit and credit entries,
            T-accounts help maintain order and consistency in recording financial data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> T-accounts help ensure the accuracy of financial records by
            providing a structured format for tracking transactions and verifying account balances.

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Nominal Account - What is a Nominal Account?</h3>
    <p>A nominal account, also known as a temporary account, is an accounting term used to describe
        revenue, expense, and dividend accounts. These accounts are closed at the end of each
        accounting period, typically a fiscal year, to transfer their balances to permanent balance
        sheet accounts. Nominal accounts are used to track the flow of revenues and expenses over
        time and are crucial for assessing a company's profitability.</p>
    <p>Key Points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nominal accounts are temporary accounts used to track revenues, expenses, and
            dividends.
        </li>
        <li>They are closed at the end of each accounting period to transfer their balances to
            permanent balance sheet accounts.
        </li>
        <li>Examples of nominal accounts include sales revenue, salaries expense, rent expense, and
            dividend income.
        </li>
        <li>The closing process involves transferring the balances of nominal accounts to the
            retained earnings or income summary account.
        </li>
        <li>Nominal accounts are crucial for assessing a company's financial performance and
            preparing financial statements.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In financial transactions recording, businesses typically use three types of nominal
        accounts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Revenue Account:</strong> This account logs all financial transactions related
            to receipts or cash inflow for the business. It appears in the profit and loss statement
            and aids in assessing the company's financial position. A high balance in the revenue
            account indicates a financially strong business with good overall performance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Expense Account:</strong> This account records all expenses resulting in cash
            outflow for the business or all expenditures incurred. Transactions for this account are
            recorded monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gains and Losses Account:</strong> This account summarizes all gains and losses
            incurred by the business in a fiscal year. Management, shareholders, and other
            stakeholders utilize this information to make crucial business and investment decisions.
            It helps in understanding the company's financial health and its future growth and
            expansion potential.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Illustrative Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Consider a manufacturing company that sells its products to customers. Each time the company
        sells a product, it generates revenue, which is recorded in the revenue account.
        Additionally, the company incurs various expenses such as raw material costs, labor costs,
        and overhead expenses, which are recorded in the expense account. At the end of the fiscal
        year, the company calculates its gains and losses, taking into account factors such as sales
        revenue, expenses, and other income sources. This information is crucial for evaluating the
        company's financial performance and making informed business decisions.</p>

<section class="article-section">
    <h3 class="sub-heading">Accounting Cycle - Understanding the Accounting Cycle</h3>
    <p>The accounting cycle is a systematic process that businesses follow to record, analyze, and
        report financial transactions. It typically spans a specific period, such as a month,
        quarter, or year, depending on the reporting requirements of the business and regulatory
        authorities.</p>
    <p>The accounting cycle typically includes the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identifying and Analyzing Transactions:</strong> The cycle starts with
            identifying and analyzing business transactions. This involves determining the nature of
            the transaction, its impact on the financial statements, and the accounts affected.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Journalizing Transactions:</strong> Once transactions are analyzed, they are
            recorded in the journal using double-entry accounting. Each transaction is recorded with
            a debit to one account and a credit to another account.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Posting to the Ledger:</strong> After journalizing transactions, the next step
            is to post them to the general ledger. The ledger contains individual accounts for
            assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparing Trial Balance:</strong> A trial balance is prepared to ensure that
            debits equal credits after posting transactions to the ledger. It lists all the accounts
            and their balances to verify the accuracy of the recording process.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adjusting Entries:</strong> Adjusting entries are made at the end of the
            accounting period to record revenues and expenses that have not yet been recorded and to
            update account balances for accruals, deferrals, and depreciation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preparing Financial Statements:</strong> Once adjusting entries are made,
            financial statements are prepared. The primary financial statements include the income
            statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Closing Entries:</strong> Closing entries are made at the end of the accounting
            period to transfer the balances of temporary accounts (revenue, expense, and dividend
            accounts) to the retained earnings account. This resets the temporary accounts for the
            next accounting period.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reversing Entries (Optional):</strong> Reversing entries may be made at the
            beginning of the next accounting period to simplify the recording process for certain
            transactions, such as accruals.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> The accounting cycle repeats regularly and usually aligns with the
        business's reporting period. For example, if a company prepares quarterly financial
        statements, the accounting cycle would occur every three months.</p>
    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> The accounting cycle is crucial for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensures accurate financial reporting: By following a structured process, businesses can
            maintain accurate and reliable financial records, which are essential for stakeholders'
            decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>Facilitates regulatory compliance: Adhering to the accounting cycle helps businesses
            comply with accounting standards and regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of
            penalties or legal issues.
        </li>
        <li>Supports decision-making: Timely and accurate financial information produced during the
            accounting cycle enables management to make informed decisions about resource
            allocation, investments, and strategic planning.
        </li>
        <li>Enhances transparency and accountability: The accounting cycle promotes transparency by
            documenting all financial transactions and activities, fostering trust among investors,
            creditors, and other stakeholders.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The accounting cycle offers several benefits to businesses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Organized financial management: By following a structured process, businesses can
            effectively manage their financial affairs, track performance, and identify areas for
            improvement.
        </li>
        <li>Streamlined reporting: The accounting cycle streamlines the preparation of financial
            statements, making it easier for businesses to fulfill their reporting obligations to
            stakeholders and regulatory authorities.
        </li>
        <li>Improved decision-making: Accurate and timely financial information generated through
            the accounting cycle enables management to make informed decisions that drive the
            business's growth and profitability.
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced financial control: Through regular review and reconciliation of accounts,
            businesses can maintain financial control, detect errors or irregularities, and prevent
            fraud.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Let's consider a retail business that sells merchandise. Throughout the accounting cycle, the
        business records various transactions, such as sales revenue, inventory purchases, operating
        expenses, and interest income. At the end of the accounting period, the business prepares
        adjusting entries to account for unpaid expenses, unearned revenues, and depreciation. These
        adjustments ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the business's financial
        position and performance.</p>

    <p>Financial statements are formal records of the financial activities and position of a
        business, person, or other entity. They provide valuable information about a company's
        financial performance, liquidity, and overall health. The main types of financial statements
        include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Also known as the profit and loss statement, the
            income statement provides a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, and net income or
            loss over a specific period. It helps investors and stakeholders evaluate the company's
            profitability.

    <p>Financial statements are prepared according to accounting principles and standards, such as
        Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting
        Standards (IFRS). They are essential for various stakeholders, including investors,
        creditors, regulators, and internal management, to make informed decisions about the
        entity.</p>
    <p>Interpreting financial statements requires an understanding of accounting concepts and
        financial analysis techniques. Analysts use ratio analysis, trend analysis, and other tools
        to assess a company's financial performance and identify areas of strength and weakness.</p>
    <p>However, financial statements also have limitations. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Historical Information: Financial statements reflect past performance and may not
            accurately predict future performance.
        </li>
        <li>Subjectivity: Certain accounting principles, such as revenue recognition and asset
            valuation, involve subjective judgments that may vary between companies.
        </li>
        <li>Omission of Intangible Assets: Financial statements may not fully capture the value of
            intangible assets, such as brand reputation or intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>Complexity: Financial statements can be complex and may require expertise to interpret
            accurately.
        </li>
        <li>External Factors: Economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other external factors
            can influence the information presented in financial statements.
