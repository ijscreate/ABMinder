    <h3>Financial Accounting</h3>
    <p>XYZ Manufacturing uses financial accounting to prepare financial statements, such as balance
        sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements, that provide an overview of the
        company's financial health and performance. These statements are prepared in accordance with
        GAAP principles and are audited by an independent accounting firm to ensure their accuracy
        and completeness. The financial statements are used by investors, creditors, and regulatory
        agencies to make informed decisions about the company's financial position and
        performance.</p>

        management make informed decisions about pricing, production, and profitability.</p>

        accurately determine the cost of a project or venture. The company's cost accountants
        consider all factors of manufacturing, such as direct materials, direct labor, and overhead
        costs, to prepare and present reports that inform decision-makers on how to reduce costs,
        when to spend more, and how to monitor projects for waste and cost control.</p>

    <h3>Auditing</h3>
    <p>XYZ Manufacturing undergoes both internal and external audits to ensure accurate reporting,
        compliance with tax laws and regulations, and financial integrity. The company's internal
        auditors identify and prevent tax issues or prepare the business for an outside audit, while
        external auditors examine the company's financial statements for accuracy and evaluate the
        adequacies of the company's internal controls.</p>

    <h3>Tax Accounting</h3>

        planning or in the preparation of tax returns. The company's tax accountants calculate
        income and other taxes depending on the structure of the business and offer advisory
        services on minimizing taxes or the consequences of tax decisions.</p>

    <h3>Fiduciary Accounting</h3>
    <p>XYZ Manufacturing uses fiduciary accounting to handle the accounts entrusted to the person
        responsible for custody or management of property. The company's fiduciary accountants track
        and report receipts and disbursements from accounts to ensure proper fund allocations and
        are frequently used by guardians or custodians.</p>

        results of its economic activity, comply with regulations, communicate financial information
        to stakeholders, and make informed decisions about the use of money, pricing, production,
