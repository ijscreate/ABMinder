    <h2>What is an Annuity?</h2>
    <p>An annuity is a financial product that provides a series of payments over a specified period
        of time. Annuities are typically purchased from insurance companies and can be structured to
        provide income for a fixed period, such as 10 or 20 years, or for the rest of the
        annuitant's life.</p>
    <p>Annuities are often used as a retirement planning tool, as they provide a steady stream of
        income over a long period of time. They can be purchased from insurance companies, banks, or
        other financial institutions, and can be customized to meet the specific needs and goals of
        the annuitant. </p>
    <p>
        When purchasing an annuity, it's important to consider factors such as the interest rate,
        fees and expenses, and the creditworthiness of the issuing institution. It's also important
        to understand the terms and conditions of the annuity, such as any surrender charges or
        penalties for early withdrawal.</p>
    <p>There are several types of annuities, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed annuities</li>
        <li>Variable annuities</li>
        <li>Indexed annuities</li>
        <li>Immediate annuities</li>
        <li>Deferred annuities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each type of annuity has its own features and benefits, and the choice of annuity depends on
        the individual's financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>
    <p>Annuities can be used to provide retirement income, fund education expenses, or serve as a
        source of guaranteed income. They can also be used as part of a broader investment strategy
        to diversify risk and ensure financial stability.</p>
    <p>It's important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of an annuity before purchasing
        one, as they can vary widely depending on the issuer and the type of annuity.</p>

        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Guaranteed income stream: Annuities provide a guaranteed income stream for a fixed
                period or for the rest of your life, which can be helpful for retirees who want to
                ensure they don't outlive their savings.
            </td>
            <td>Fees and expenses: Annuities often come with high fees and expenses, such as
                management fees, mortality and expense risk charges, and surrender charges. These
                fees can eat into your investment returns and reduce the overall value of the
                annuity.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tax-deferred growth: Annuities grow tax-deferred, which means you won't have to pay
                taxes on the gains until you withdraw the money. This can help your savings grow
                faster over time.
            </td>
            <td>Lack of liquidity: Annuities typically have withdrawal restrictions and surrender
                charges, which can make it difficult to access your money if you need it.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Flexibility: Annuities can be customized to meet your specific needs and goals. For
                example, you can choose a fixed annuity with a guaranteed interest rate, or a
                variable annuity that allows you to invest in mutual funds.
            </td>
            <td>Complexity: Annuities can be complex financial products with a variety of features
                and options, which can make them difficult to understand and compare.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Creditor protection: Annuities are often protected from creditors, which can be
                helpful for individuals who are concerned about potential lawsuits or other
                financial liabilities.
            </td>
            <td>Inflation risk: Fixed annuities may not keep up with inflation, which can erode the
                purchasing power of your annuity payments over time.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Death benefit: Many annuities offer a death benefit that pays out to your
                beneficiaries if you die before the annuity period ends.
            </td>
            <td>Longevity risk: Annuities that provide lifetime income may not provide enough income
                if you live longer than expected, which can leave you financially vulnerable in your
                later years.
            </td>

    <p>Whether an annuity is a good fit for your financial situation depends on your
        specific needs, goals, and risk tolerance. It's important to carefully consider the pros and
        cons of annuities and to consult with a financial advisor before making a decision.</p>

    <h3>Example of How Annuities Work</h3>
    <p>Let's say you're 65 years old and you have saved PHP 1,000,000 for retirement. You're
        concerned about outliving your savings, so you decide to purchase an annuity to provide a
        guaranteed income stream for the rest of your life.</p>
    <p>You purchase a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) from an insurance company. You pay a
        lump sum of PHP 1,000,000, and in return, the insurance company agrees to pay you a fixed
        monthly income of PHP 50,000 for the rest of your life, starting immediately.</p>
    <p>The insurance company invests your lump sum and earns interest on it, using the income
        generated to fund your monthly payments. The interest rate and payment amount are
        guaranteed, so you can count on receiving PHP 50,000 each month for as long as you live.</p>
    <p>If you live to be 85 years old, you will have received PHP 600,000 in annuity payments over
        20 years, in addition to the PHP 1,000,000 you initially invested. If you live to be 95
        years old, you will have received PHP 1,200,000 in annuity payments over 30 years.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are many different types of annuities and the specific terms and conditions
        will vary depending on the product you choose. But this example gives you an idea of how an
        annuity can provide a guaranteed income stream for the rest of your life.</p>
