    <h2 class="assets-heading">Assets</h2>
    <div class="assets-content">
        <p>Assets are properties or rights on properties owned by the business. They are items of
            value that belong to the business. In general, common examples of assets are cash,
            tools, equipment, building, and land.</p>
        <p>An asset is under the control and custodianship of the entity as a result of a past
            transaction such as a purchase, an exchange, or a donation. The asset will generate for
            the entity. The following describe further what an asset is.</p>
        <ul class="assets-list">
            <li class="assets-item">
                <span class="assets-item-title">Assets are controlled by the enterprise.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="assets-item">
                <span class="assets-item-title">Assets result from past events.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="assets-item">
                <span class="assets-item-title">Assets give future economic benefits.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="assets-item">
                <span class="assets-item-title">Assets can be used by themselves alone to yield income.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Different kinds of assets can be used to generate income. A set of kitchen utensils is
            used to cook the dish that served at a restaurant. Hence, both the kitchen utensils and
            the restaurant premises (if owned by the business) are assets.</p>
        <p>Specifically, assets include cash and cash equivalent, notes receivable, accounts
            receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses, property, plant and equipment, investment,
            intangible assets, and other assets.</p>
        <h3 class="assets-subheading">Tangible Assets and Intangible Assets</h3>
        <p>Tangible assets have a physical existence that can be touched and felt. They are used
            primarily in the operation of the business to produce products or services. Examples of
            tangible assets include buildings, automobiles, physical inventory, furniture, and
            machines. Tangible assets are depreciated over time as they are used in the
            business.</p>
        <p>Intangible assets, on the other hand, do not have a physical character, but they are
            essential to the continued operation of a business. Examples of intangible assets
            include goodwill, intellectual property (patents, copyrights, and trademarks), brand
            names, customer relationships, contracts, and non-compete agreements.</p>
        <h3 class="assets-subheading">Current Assets and Non-Current Assets</h3>
        <p>Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within
            one year or less. These assets are used to fund day-to-day operations and current
            expenditure. Examples of current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
            receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, and marketable securities.</p>
        <p>Non-current assets, on the other hand, are assets that are not expected to be converted
            into cash or used up within one year. These assets are seen as long-term investments,
            which are intended to create long-term benefits. Examples of non-current assets include
            land, property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), long-term investments, trademarks, and
            goodwill.</p>
