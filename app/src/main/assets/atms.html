<h2>Understanding Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)</h2>

<p>An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables
    customers of financial institutions to perform various financial transactions without the need
    for direct interaction with bank staff.</p>

<p>ATMs, known by various names such as automatic teller machines (ATM), automated banking machines
    (ABM), cashpoints, and cash machines, are accessed using a plastic ATM card with a personal
    identification number (PIN) for authentication.</p>

<p>The first ATM was installed in London in 1967, and since then, they have become a ubiquitous part
    of the financial landscape, with millions installed worldwide. However, their use has been
    gradually declining with the increase in cashless payment systems.</p>

<p>ATMs are connected to interbank networks, allowing customers to withdraw and deposit money from
    machines not belonging to their bank. However, ATM use may incur fees, charged to non-customers
    or all users.</p>

<p>ATMs rely on authorization from the card issuer or other authorizing institution, often performed
    through an ISO 8583 messaging system. They connect directly to their host or ATM Controller
    using ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or leased lines.</p>

<h2>Types of ATMs:</h2>
