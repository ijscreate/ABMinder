<h2>Bank Reconciliation Statement</h2>
<p>A company prepares a bank reconciliation statement to compare the balance in its accounting
    records with its bank account balance. The statement shows reasons for any discrepancies between
    the two. A bank reconciliation statement is a valuable internal tool that can affect tax and
    financial reporting and detect errors and intentional fraud.</p>

<h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
<p>Understanding the Bank Reconciliation Statement</p>
<p>Reconciliation is the process of comparing two different records. A bank reconciliation statement
    can help you identify differences between your company’s bank and book balances.</p>
<p>In this case, the reconciliation includes the deposits, withdrawals, and other activities
    affecting a bank account for a specific period. Any discrepancies lead to making necessary
    adjustments or corrections.</p>

<p>Here are other uses of a bank reconciliation statement.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identifying Accounting Errors</li>
    <li>Detecting Fraud</li>
</ul>

<h3>How To Do a Bank Reconciliation?</h3>
<p>To successfully complete your bank reconciliation, you’ll need your bank statements for the
    current and previous months as well as your company ledger. An online template can help guide
    you, but a simple spreadsheet is just as effective.</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps to follow:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Gather a copy of the bank statement for the period and your accounting system or company
        ledger list of all payments, deposits, and cash account balances from the accounting system.
    </li>
    <li>Start with your closing balance for the prior month. That will be your starting number.</li>
    <li>Examine each bank statement item leaving the bank account, such as checks, transfers, and
        bank fees. Each statement item should be on your leger or system list. Ensure that your
        deposits and cleared checks match the amounts the bank recorded. If not, record the missing
        or incorrect item.
    </li>
    <li>Review bank transaction items on the statement that add to the account, such as interest,
        deposits, transfers, and bank adjustments. Each positive transaction should also be
        reflected in your ledger or accounting system. If not, record the missing item.
    </li>
    <li>At the end of your bank reconciliation statement process, the accounting record’s balance
        (after making adjustments) should equal the bank statement balance.
    </li>
    <li>If there are further discrepancies, investigate what might have been missed in your
        recording or errors that may have been made at the bank.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Example of a Bank Reconciliation Statement</h3>
<p>Bank reconciliation statements compare transactions from financial records with those on a bank
    statement. Where there are discrepancies, companies can identify and correct the source of
    errors.</p>

<h3>What Are Common Problems With Bank Reconciliations?</h3>
<p>Infrequent reconciliations make it difficult to address problems with fraud or errors when they
    first arise, as the needed information may not be readily available. Also, when transactions
    aren't recorded promptly and bank fees and charges are applied, it can cause mismatches in the
    company's accounting records.</p>

<h3>Why Is Bank Reconciliation Important?</h3>
<p>Bank reconciliation helps to identify errors that can affect estimated tax payments and financial
    reporting. It also helps to identify, stop, and prevent fraud.</p>

<h3>How Often Should You Do a Bank Reconciliation?</h3>
<p>To quickly identify and address errors, reconciling bank statements should be done by companies
    or individuals at least monthly. They also can be done as frequently as statements are
    generated, such as daily or weekly.</p>

<p>For example, let's consider a company named XYZ Corp. The bank balance is lower due to a few
    banking-related errors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The client's payment of ₱1000 isn’t reflected as the client made a mistake with the account
        number.
    </li>
    <li>The Bank transaction failed, and the refund of ₱1000 hasn’t been processed.</li>
    <li>The Bank statement shows an error where an inbound ₱1000 transaction is accounted for as
        ₱3000.
    </li>
    <li>The bank lost or misplaced your check for ₱2000.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reconcile the accounts, the company would need to adjust the bank balance by adding pending
    deposits (deposit-in-transit) and deducting pending outgoing checks (outstanding checks). The
    cashbook balance needs adjustment for bank service fees, accrued interest, and rejected checks
    (NSF checks).</p>

<p>Bank reconciliation is important for detecting fraud and any cash manipulations, ensuring that
    the company's cash records are correct, and monitoring and updating its funds. It helps the
    company identify any discrepancies that may arise and rectify or appropriately explain them.</p>

<p>There are various reasons for differences between the company's cashbook and the bank statements,
    including bank charges, outstanding checks, payment delays, accounting/banking errors, and
    deposits in transit. Bank reconciliation helps identify and resolve these discrepancies,
    ensuring that the company's financial records accurately reflect its cash balances.</p>
