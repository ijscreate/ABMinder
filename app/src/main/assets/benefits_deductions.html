<h2>Employee Benefits and Provisions in the Philippines</h2>
<p>Here are the employee benefits and provisions in the Philippines:</p>

<section>
    <h3>Wage and Compensation</h3>
    <h4>Minimum Wage</h4>
    <p>The government has set minimum wage rates across different regions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NCR – P537 (since Nov. 22, 2018)</li>
        <li>CAR – P300-P320</li>
        <!-- Other regions... -->
    </ul>

    <h4>Overtime Pay</h4>
    <p>When an employee works at least one hour beyond their regular work hours, they are entitled
        to an additional 25% of the per-hour rate. Here’s a sample computation: </p>
    <pre>
Salary per month: P30,000

No. of days per month: 26

Salary per day: P1,153.85

Salary per hour (8-hour shift): P144.23

Overtime rate per: P180.28 (144.23 x 0.25 = 36.05 + 144.23)

No. of OT hours: 2.0

Total OT pay: P360.56 (P180.28 x 2)
    </pre>

    <h4>13th-month pay</h4>
    <p>This is not to be mistaken for the Christmas bonus, which is subject to the discretion of the
        company. The 13th-month pay, on the other hand, is government-mandated. It is given to an
        employee of a private company with a fixed or regular salary and who has worked for the
        company for at least a month. If you quit before the 13th-month is released, you can still
        receive it but only if you go through the separation process. Those who are only on a
        commission basis are not entitled to this benefit. <br>
        <br>
        Take note that your 13th-month pay depends on the number of months in the year you have
        worked for the company. If it’s 12 months and you didn’t have any absences or unpaid leaves,
        then you get that extra month pay in full. Otherwise, it will be prorated: </p>

    <pre>

        [BS – A/UL] / 12 x N = 13TH-MONTH PAY
    </pre>
    <p>(Basic Salary minus Absences/Unpaid Leaves divided by 12 multiplied by the number of months
        you have worked for the company in that particular year.) </p>
    <p>Under the new Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, if your 13th-month pay
        is P90,000 or less, it shall be exempted from tax. </p>

    <h4>Separation pay</h4>
    <p>If you get terminated from your work not because of misconduct or involvement in any crime,
        you are entitled to separation pay, the amount of which depends on the reason for
        termination: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>50% of your monthly pay per year of service if termination is due to retrenchment to
            keep the company from closure or if it has gone bankrupt or if you have become seriously
            sick and are not expected to get well within six months and the sickness is contagious.
        </li>
        <li>100% of your monthly pay per year of service if termination is because of the following:
            new machines or devices are installed that will do your job instead; excess in manpower;
            redundancy; and if you have been promoted, there is no way for you to be reinstated to
            your previous position.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Retirement Pay</h4>
    <p>When you reach the age of 60, have been with the company for at least five years, and you
        decide to retire, you can receive a retirement pay of at least 50% of your current monthly
        salary multiplied by the number of years of service. Six months or more is considered as one
        whole year. </p>

    <h4>Nigh0shift Differential</h4>
    <p>If your work schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. you are eligible for a night shift
        differential, which gives a 10% premium for every hour at work. There are eight
        configurations of the NSD to take note of: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordinary Day NSD – hourly rate x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Rest Day NSD – hourly rate x 130% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Regular Holiday NSD – hourly rate x 200% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Special Holiday NSD – hourly rate x 130% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Double Holiday NSD – hourly rate x 330% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Regular Holiday + Rest Day NSD – hourly rate x 260% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Special Holiday + Rest Day NSD – hourly rate x 150% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
        <li>Double Holiday + Rest Day NSD – hourly rate x 390% x 10% x 8 hours</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Special non-working holiday pay</h4>
    <p>Also known as Special Holidays, these are days declared as such by the president or the local
        government unit (LGU) in a specific region or enacted by Congress. Some examples of a
        special holiday are the EDSA People Power Revolution anniversary every Feb. 25 and the
        Chinese New Year. Working during a special holiday will earn you a 130% premium on your
        hourly rate, the same if you work on your rest day: </p>
    <pre>
Hourly Rate x 130% x 8 Hours

However, if you work on a special holiday that also falls on your rest day:

Hourly Rate x 150% x 8 Hours
    </pre>

    <h4>Regular holiday pay</h4>
    <p>Regular holidays are official holidays normally with fixed dates such as Christmas Day, New
        Year’s Day, and Independence Day. National Heroes Day, Maundy Thursday, and Good Friday are
        also considered regular holidays even though they fall on different dates. If you work on a
        regular holiday, here’s how your pay for the day should compute: </p>

    <h4>Double holiday pay</h4>
    <p>Double holidays are rare but they do occur from time to time such as in 2018 when President
        Rodrigo Duterte declared Aug. 21 as a special non-working holiday on top of it being a Ninoy
        Aquino Day (a regular holiday). If you had worked on that day, here’s the computation for
        your pay: </p>
    <pre>

        Hourly Rate x 300% x 8 Hours

    </pre>
    <p>Incidentally, the computation above also applies should that day also happen to be your rest
        day. </p>

    <h3>Leave Benefits </h3>
    <p>Employee benefits also include a number of different leaves.</p>
    <h4>Service incentive leave</h4>
    <p>An employee who has been with the same company for a year is eligible for 5 service incentive
        leaves that may be used as vacation leave or sick leave. Many companies, however, offer 15
        days of sick leave and 15 days of vacation leave, all paid. Sometimes, these leaves, if not
        used, can even be converted to their monetary equivalent that is paid out usually before the
        end of the year. </p>

    <h4>Maternity leave</h4>
    <p>Women who have worked for at least six months in a company shall have at least two weeks of
        leave before their delivery date and four weeks thereafter and still receive their full
        regular salary. The Expanded Maternity Bill (EML), which took effect last Feb. 21, 2019,
        allows for women to take 105 days off as maternity leave and even an additional 30 days of
        unpaid leave. </p>

    <h4>Paternity leave</h4>
    <p>Married fathers are granted seven days of fully paid leave after the delivery of their child.
        This applies to up to the first four births of their legitimate wives. The EML also allows
        the wife to transfer seven days of their maternity leave to their husband so that the
        paternity leave can be extended to up to 14 days. </p>

    <h4>Parental leave for solo parents</h4>
    <p>On top of the other leave privileges, a solo mother or father also gets an additional seven
        days leave with pay for each year of service to their company. The EML is also applicable to
        solo mothers so they can avail of 105 days of paid maternity leave credits. Moreover, they
        can extend it to another 15 days that are also paid. </p>

    <h4>Special leaves for women </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Women and children victims of violence – The Anti-Violence Against Women and Their
            Children Act of 2004 (Republic Act 9262) allows women victims of violence a paid 10-day
            leave.
        </li>
        <li>
            Magna Carta for Women – also known as R.A. 9710, this law grants a leave of two months
            with pay to women who have had surgery for gynecological disorders. It applies to those
            who have been with the same company for at least six months.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Bereavement leave</h4>
    <p>An employee can avail of three days off due to the death of an immediate family member. This
        leave, though, is unpaid. </p>

    <p style="border-bottom: 1px solid black"> </p>

    <h4>De Minimis benefits</h4>
    <p>Totally dependent on a company’s capability, these employee benefits can be small financial
        help or leave credits. They include rice subsidy, internet/electricity subsidy (arising from
        the work-from-home setup of companies as a result of the pandemic), meal allowance,
        transportation allowance, and calamity leave. </p>

<section>
    <h3>Mandatory Government Contributions</h3>
    <h4>SSS Contribution</h4>
    <p>The government’s insurance program for employees of private companies. Its counterpart for
        government employees is the GSIS. A specific amount is deducted from the employee based on
        their salary bracket and is remitted to the SSS together with a corresponding amount from
        the employer. <br>
<br>
        The amount the SSS collects from all its members is used to fund various benefits to cover
        sickness, disability, death, funeral, maternity, retirement, and salary and housing
        loans. </p>

    <h4>PhilHealth contribution</h4>
    <p>The government’s health insurance program for employees of private companies, granting
        financial assistance and even service for health care. Monthly contributions, just like with
        the SSS, are shared by both employee and employer. </p>

    <h4>Pag-IBIG contribution </h4>
    <p>Similar to the SSS contribution, this one is also a national savings program with a special
        focus on providing affordable homes to Filipinos. The employee and employer shoulder the
        regular contribution to Pag-IBIG. In return, members can avail of a housing loan, calamity
        loan, or multi-purpose loan.</p>
