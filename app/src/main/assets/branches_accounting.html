<body><h2>The Different Branches of Accounting</h2>
<p>Accounting branches are specialized areas of accounting that focus on specific aspects of
    financial and non-financial information that affects a business's economic interests and
    associations. Most businesses and corporations use accounting branches to measure the results of
    the organization's economic activity. Accounting branches use various methods to compile and
    report results to investors, creditors, management, regulators, or tax collectors.</p>
<p>The increase in global business and the expansion of tax laws and regulations have led to the
    evolution of accounting branches and the development of specialties in particular areas of
    finance. Developments in technology and the exchange of international currencies have also
    resulted in the expansion of accounting specialties that focus on specific economic
    interests.</p>

<h3>1. Financial Accounting</h3>
<p>Financial accounting involves recording and clarifying business transactions along with
    preparation and presentation of financial statements. Financial accounting follows GAAP
    principles and focuses on historical data. For example, a financial accountant may analyze the
    financial records of the previous quarter to make recommendations for changes in the next
    quarter. Financial accounting analyzes the company's balance sheet and prepares profit and loss
    statements that advise management or stakeholders in regards to loans, investments, or
    acquisitions.</p>
<p>Financial accounting provides vital economic business information for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creditors</li>
    <li>Banks or financial institutions</li>
    <li>Regulators</li>
    <li>Suppliers</li>
    <li>Tax professionals</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Managerial Accounting</h3>
<p>Managerial accounting provides information to a company's internal structure, namely management.
    Unlike financial accounting, managerial accountants monitor the use of money, rather than
    amounts of money. Managerial accounting places the focus on the needs of management and doesn't
    necessarily follow GAAP accounting rules. The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
    developed a set of accounting principles, known as Global Management Accounting Principles
    (GMAP) that relate directly to this discipline.</p>
<p>Managerial accounting works to improve the company's administration, enhance its profit, and
    provide management with financial reports that influence planning and budgets. This branch of
    accounting performs forecasting to advise management on the best business practices to meet
    goals and maintain profit. Managerial accounting includes conducting internal examinations
    through cost to volume profit (CVP) or break-even point (BEP) analysis, factors that affect
    decision making.</p>
<h3>3. Cost Accounting</h3>
<p>Cost accounting, considered a subset of management accounting, focuses on evaluating costs. This
    branch considers all factors of manufacturing to accurately determine the cost of a project or
    venture. Cost accounting analyzes manufacturing costs to prepare and present reports that inform
    decision-makers on how to reduce cost, or when to spend more. It monitors projects for waste and
    cost control. Cost accounting regularly analyzes actual costs over budget to determine future
    monetary actions.</p>
<h3>4. Auditing</h3>
<p>Auditing is a branch of accounting that is usually done internally and externally. Auditors
    examine and monitor a business for accurate reporting, compliance with tax laws and regulations,
    and financial integrity. There are two specializations for auditors:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>External auditor:</strong> External auditing takes place with an independent,
        outside auditor who examines a company's financial statements for accuracy. Auditing
        complies with GAAP and evaluates the adequacies of a company's internal controls. External
        auditors may test the company's segregation of duties, policies, authorizations and other
        management controls for efficacy and integrity
        .
    </li>
    <li><strong>Internal auditor:</strong> Internal auditing identifies and prevents tax issues or
        prepares the business for an outside audit. Auditors in this branch are typically chosen by
        shareholders so their role doesn't present a conflict of interest and ensures their
        objectivity
        .
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Tax Accounting</h3>
<p>Tax accounting follows state and federal tax rules during tax planning or in the preparation of
    tax returns. This branch reports on the effect of taxes on a business and may offer advisory
    services on minimizing taxes or the consequences of tax decisions. Tax accountants calculate
    income and other taxes depending on the structure of the business. Since taxes and income
    brackets vary from entity to entity, tax accounting is well-versed in tax laws surrounding sole
    proprietorships, corporations and limited liability corporations (LLC).</p>
<h3>6. Fiduciary Accounting</h3>
<p>Fiduciary accounting handles the accounts entrusted to the person responsible for custody or
    management of property. The branch tracks and reports receipts and disbursements from accounts
    to ensure proper fund allocations and is frequently used by guardians or custodians.</p>
<p>Fiduciary accounting typically serves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trusts</li>
    <li>Receiverships</li>
    <li>Estates</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Project Accounting</h3>
<p>Some industries, such as construction or engineering, work on large projects that require a
    dedicated accountant. Project accounting falls under the project management umbrella. This
    accounting analyzes costs and prepares reports at regular intervals to track a project's
    financial progress. It provides historical data to inform future project decisions including
    cost-saving measures or budget adjustments.</p>
<h3>8. Forensic Accounting</h3>
<p>Forensic accounting, also known as legal accounting, handles legal matters related to bankruptcy,
    fraud or mismanagement. This branch conducts investigations for court and litigation cases,
    calculates damages, and oversees dispute resolutions.</p>
<p>Forensic accounting serves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lawyers</li>
    <li>Law enforcement</li>
    <li>Insurance companies</li>
    <li>Government organizations</li>
    <li>Financial institutions</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Fund Accounting</h3>
<p>Fund accounting works with non-profit organizations (NPO) to ensure the correct and accurate
    allocation of funds. Fund accountants ensure NPO funds go where intended through the separation
    and distribution of funds according to the company's policies or in accordance with laws
    governing NPOs.</p>
<p>Fund accounting is frequently used by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Charities</li>
    <li>Churches</li>
    <li>Educational institutions</li>
    <li>Hospitals</li>
    <li>Government agencies</li>
    <li>Clubs</li>
</ul>
<h3>10. Government Accounting</h3>
<p>Government accounting oversees and records state and federal fund allocation and disbursement.
    This can include aspects of social accounting and the measurement of cost to humans as it
    relates to federal land use, climate change or the use of welfare funds. Government accounting
    tracks the movement of money through various agencies and ensures budget requirements are kept
    or met. Government accountants work in state and federal programs such as healthcare, housing
    and education.</p>
<h3>11. Political Campaign Accounting</h3>
<p>Political campaign accounting oversees the development and implementation of a political
    campaign's finance systems. This may include transaction accounting or donation monitoring to
    ensure compliance with federal and state laws governing political campaigns. Political campaign
    accounting is practiced in local, state or nationwide political races.</p>
<h3>12. International Accounting</h3>
<p>As global business expands, so do international markets and the need for international
    accounting. This branch of accounting serves to learn laws and regulations in other countries in
    order to conduct business honestly and fairly. International accountants not only follow GAAP,
    but are well-versed in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the accounting
    standard followed in most global economies.</p>
