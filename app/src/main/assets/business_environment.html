<h2>What Is Business Environment?</h2>
<p>A number of factors affect every business. These include both internal and external factors. The
    factors that affect a business both positively and negatively comprise its environment. These
    include factors such as management quality to human resources, political climate to
    environmental concerns. The range of factors that can potentially affect a business is huge. At
    times, the internal and external factors may affect each other as well. They may also affect the
    business together in some aspects.</p>
<h2>Features of Business Environment External Factors</h2>
<p>As stated before, every business has a number of external factors that either directly or
    indirectly affect it. These factors can range from individuals, government regulations,
    environmental concerns, to other organizations and businesses.</p>
<h3>General Factors</h3>
<p>These are factors that exist in society and the economy regardless of the business’s existence.
    They affect all the institutions. These are political, legal, technological, and other such
    aspects. General factors affect every business regardless of their size or market.</p>
<h3>Specific Factors</h3>
<p>These are the factors that are directly related to the business such as customers, target market,
    competitors, suppliers, etc. Each business has its own set of specific factors that define its
    environment.</p>
<h3>The Interrelation of Factors</h3>
<p>Most of the factors that affect a business are affected by each other as well.</p>
<h3>Uncertain Future</h3>
<p>The future of a business environment is very difficult to predict. With a large range of factors
    at play, it can change quickly. Although some businesses can successfully predict near term
    future the aspects affecting it are volatile.</p>
<h3>Constantly Changing</h3>
<p>With rapid changes in technology and various social factors, the current business landscape is a
    highly dynamic one. This makes defining a business environment very difficult.</p>
<h3>Complex Effects</h3>
<p>The effects that the various internal and external factors have on businesses are quite complex.
    They may seem like a small factor at the time but have a larger impact overall, or vice
    versa.</p>
<h2>Business Environmental Factors</h2>
<p>There are two types of primary factors that we will be looking into, internal and external
    factors. These factors define the business environment in its most understandable manner.</p>
<h3>External Environment Factors</h3>
<p>A business is a socio-economic entity. Thus, the various aspects of society play a crucial role
    in every business’s success or failure and in creating its environment. The common term given
    towards external business environment factors is PESTLE. This abbreviation stands for political,
    economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Political Factors:</strong> From the political climate of the business’ geography to
        the international relations it holds, every aspect of politics affects a business.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> The current economic condition in most countries is
        highly volatile.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Socio-cultural Factors:</strong> Every society has its unique requirements and
        choices.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Technological Factors:</strong> Technology is one of the primary drivers in today’s
        world.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Legal Factors:</strong> There are laws for businesses in every country in the world
        and every business has to abide by these laws.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> The world is currently facing an environmental
        crisis.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Internal Environment Factors</h3>
<p>The forces present within a business organization define its characteristics. These include the
    work culture, the level of machinery used, the management process, etc.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Value Framework:</strong> This is basically the business’ functional process and how
        the value in a business is judged.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Business Path:</strong> Every company has a reason to exist and a purpose to serve.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> The hierarchical or non-hierarchical structure of a business.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Organizational Culture:</strong> Although undefinable in exact terms, every business
        has a unique culture that it adheres to.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> With the size of businesses growing every day, the
        management of employees at a microlevel is performed by human resources.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Physical Resources:</strong> Every business runs on resources, and how it manages
        these resources is highly impactful towards its internal environment.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The modern tech landscape continuously defines a business
        environment both from the outside and from the inside.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A business environment is a vast concept. But each of its aspects is equally important towards
    the success of a business. The larger a business grows the more aspects it develops both
    internally and externally. Hopefully, this article was able to present you with a clear picture
    of the primary factors that every business environment constitutes.</p>
<p>A business environment is a highly volatile concept. It allows for the growth of businesses and
    also their downfall. So, every business must be highly critical about the environment they
    create and how it affects their process and persona.</p>
