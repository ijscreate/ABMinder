    <h2>Importance of Finance</h2>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Finance is a broad term that refers to the management of money and other assets. It
        encompasses activities such as investing, borrowing, lending, budgeting, saving, and
        forecasting financial outcomes. In the business context, finance involves making decisions
        about how to allocate resources, raise capital, manage risks, and maximize returns on
        investments. Personal finance, on the other hand, focuses on managing an individual's or a
        family's financial resources, including budgeting, saving for retirement, investing, and
        managing debt. Finance plays a crucial role in both individual and corporate settings by
        helping to ensure financial stability, growth, and prosperity.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Types of Business Finance</h3>
    <p>Some types of business finance include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Debt Financing:</strong> Businesses can secure loans from banks or financial
            institutions. It provides them with an influx of capital that is repaid with interest
            over a specified period. Companies may also issue bonds, which are debt securities sold
            to investors. Bondholders receive interest payments and the return of the principal
            amount upon maturity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equity Financing:</strong> Companies can raise capital by selling shares of
            ownership or stocks to investors. This form of equity financing allows investors to
            participate in the companyâ€™s ownership and potential profits.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Short-Term Financing:</strong> Businesses can negotiate with suppliers to obtain
            goods and services on credit by deferring payment for a predetermined period. Companies
            can access short-term funds by allowing their account balance to go below zero up to an
            agreed-upon limit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Financing:</strong> Startups and high-growth companies often seek
            funding from venture capitalists. In exchange for capital, the investors receive equity
            and may play an active role in business decisions.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example Scenario: Business Finance in Expanding Operations</h3>
    <p>An example scenario of business finance could involve a company considering expanding its
        operations by opening a new manufacturing facility. Here's how business finance would come
        into play in this scenario:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Investment Decision:</strong> The company's financial management team would need
            to evaluate the costs associated with acquiring land, constructing the facility,
            purchasing equipment, and hiring additional staff. They would analyze the expected cash
            flows, return on investment, and risks involved in the expansion project.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Financing Decision:</strong> Once the investment analysis is complete, the
            financial managers would decide on the most suitable financing options to fund the
            expansion. They might consider using a combination of internal funds, bank loans,
            issuing bonds, or seeking equity investment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Financial Planning:</strong> Business finance professionals would create
            financial projections, budgets, and cash flow forecasts to assess the financial
            feasibility of the expansion project. They would also develop a financing plan to ensure
            that the company has sufficient funds to support the new facility's operations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Financial managers would identify and evaluate
            potential risks associated with the expansion, such as market risks, operational risks,
            regulatory risks, and financial risks. They would implement risk mitigation strategies
            to safeguard the company's financial health.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capital Budgeting:</strong> Using capital budgeting techniques like Net Present
            Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the finance team would assess the
            profitability and viability of the expansion project. This analysis helps in making
            informed decisions about whether to proceed with the investment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Control:</strong> Once the new facility is operational, financial
            managers would continuously monitor the financial performance of the project, compare
            actual results with forecasts, and take corrective actions if needed to ensure that the
            investment generates the expected returns.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example scenario, business finance plays a critical role in guiding strategic
        decisions, managing resources effectively, and ensuring the financial success of the
        company's expansion initiative.</p>

    <h3>THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>Financial System is a framework which collectively describes the financial markets, financial
        institutions, borrowers and lenders within the economy. The functions of the financial
        system is to channel the funds from lenders to the borrowers, provide a medium of exchange,
        provide a mechanism for risk sharing and provide a channel through which the central bank
        can influence the economy.</p>
    <h3>Financial Instruments</h3>
    <p>These things are crucial to the operation of the economy. A financial instrument is the
        written legal obligation of one party to transfer a thing of value, usually money, to
        another party at some future date, under certain conditions. According to the Philippine
        Accounting Standards 32, a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a
        financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another
        entity. With this definition, we can also consider currency bills and coins as financial
        instruments because they are financial assets of the person holding the money and a
        financial liability of the government issuing it. In business, when we say financial
        instruments, we basically refer to stocks bonds and notes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> This is a type of security that signifies ownership in a
            corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation's assets and earnings.
            Stocks are issued by companies in order to raise funds for the business. Generally, this
            can be classified as common and preferred stock. This is a financial asset of the
            stockholder and an equity instrument of the issuing company.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> A bond is a debt security in which an investor lends his money
            to an entity which borrows the funds for a defined period of time at defined interest
            rate. Bonds are usually issued by companies, municipalities, states and sovereign
            governments to raise money and finance their economic activities. A bond is a financial
            asset of the investor â€“reflected as Bonds Receivable and a financial liability of the
            issuing company â€“reflected as Bonds Payable.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> This is a debt security obligating repayment of a loan with a
            corresponding interest within a defined period of time. Notes are being issued by the
            borrower to signify its indebtedness. A note is the financial liability of the debtor -
            reflected as Notes Payable and a financial asset of the creditor - reflected as Notes
            Receivable.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Financial Markets</h3>
    <p>A financial market is where stocks, bonds and other financial securities can be purchased or
        sold. Funds are transferred in financial markets when one party purchases financial assets
        previously held by another party. Financial markets facilitate the flow of funds and thereby
        allow financing and investing by households, firms, and government agencies.</p>
    <p>Financial markets may be classified into two namely the money market and the capital market.
        The money market is where debt securities with an original maturity of one year or less are
        traded as well as long-term securities having at least six months left to maturity. The
        capital market is where securities with maturity of more than one year are traded. The
        capital market is subdivided into bond market, stock market and mortgage market.</p>
    <p>Some financial markets may exist but have few activities. In the country, the large financial
        markets are those being regulated by the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas. These are the foreign
        exchange market, the fixed income exchange market and the stock market. The BSP upholds and
        maintains the efficient and safe operations of these financial markets.</p>
    <h3>Fixed Income Exchange Market</h3>
    <p>The Fixed Income Exchange is the countryâ€™s first centralized electronic infrastructure for
        trading of fixed-income securities. The FIE is a comprehensive financial market
        infrastructure that aims to provide an electronic platform for trading, clearing and
        settlement, and depository and custodianship fixed-income securities and its derivatives.
        When we say fixed-income securities, these are investments that provide return in the form
        of fixed periodic payments and the eventual return of principal at maturity. This may
        include treasury bonds and certificate of deposits.</p>
    <h3>Stock Market</h3>
    <p>The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is a private organization created to provide and maintain
        a fair, efficient, transparent and orderly market for the purchase and sale of stocks and
        other securities.</p>
    <h3>Financial Intermediaries</h3>
    <p>A financial intermediary is an entity that acts as the middleman between two parties in a
        financial transaction. Financial intermediaries are businesses which move money from the
        individual into the markets. With this statement, we can say that those who are borrowing in
        financial intermediaries are said to be engaged in indirect financing. Financial
        institutions are considered as the financial intermediaries.</p>
    <p>A financial institution is an establishment that provides financial services such as
        investments, loans and deposits. Typically, these are the key entities that control the flow
        of money in the economy. Financial institutions may either be a banking institution or
        non-banking institution.</p>
    <h4>Banking Institutions</h4>
    <p>A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit
        which is being supervised by a regulatory agency.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commercial Bank:</strong> This is a financial institution that provides various
            financial services, such as accepting deposits, offering savings and checking account
            services, and issuing loans for both private individuals and businesses. Furthermore, it
            may also provide safety deposit boxes, mortgages, debit and credit cards, automated
            teller machines, online banking and other financial services. A commercial bank also has
            the power to accept drafts and issue letters of credit; discount and negotiate
            promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt; accept or
            create demand deposits; receive other types of deposits and deposit substitutes; buy and
            sell foreign exchange and gold or silver bullion; acquire marketable bonds and other
            debt securities; and extend credit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Investment Banks:</strong> Unlike commercial banks, investment banks do not take
            deposits. Their focus is assisting individuals, corporations, and governments in raising
            capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of securities.
            An investment bank may also assist companies involved in mergers and acquisitions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Non-Banking Financial Institutions</h4>
    <p>A non-banking financial institution is a financial institution that does not have a full
        banking license or is not supervised by a national or international banking regulatory
        agency.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Credit Unions:</strong> These are non-profit financial cooperatives owned by and
            operated for the benefit of its members. These member-owned financial cooperatives are
            democratically controlled by its members, and operated for the purpose of offering its
            members economical financial services. Membership is available through affiliation with
            an employer, a union, religious organization, community organization, or some other
            group.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Savings and Loan Associations:</strong> Also known as thrift banks, these are
            financial institutions that specialize in savings type deposits, mortgages and other
            loans. They provide dividends to their depositors. Today savings and loan associations
            offer most of the services commercial banks do. They can also serve both consumers and
            businesses. However, by law, they can have no more than twenty percent of their lending
            in commercial loans.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Insurance Companies:</strong> These are corporate entities that insure people
            against loss. The client pays a fee, known as a premium, in exchange for the promise of
            the company to protect the client financially in the event of certain potential
            misfortunes. The common types of insurance include health, life and property insurances.
        </li>
