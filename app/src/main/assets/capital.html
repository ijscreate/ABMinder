    <div class="capital-content">
        <p>Aside from assets and liabilities, capital is also reflected in the Statement of
            Financial Position (SFP). Initially, a proprietor invests capital in the form of funds,
            merchandise, equipment, or any other property to operate his or her business. As the
            business continues, the proprietor takes into consideration the preservation or the
            growth of his or her capital. His or her primary purpose is to maximize the use of his
            or her capital by gaining profits. The capital will grow when the business earns
            profits, but will decrease when the business incurs a loss.</p>
        <p>Equity in a single proprietorship is termed as capital account. In a partnership, there
            is a capital account for each partner. Due to the complexity of operations of large
            corporations, the shareholders’ equity section of SFP consist of ordinary share capital,
            preference share capital, appropriated and inappropriate retained earnings, and other
            special equity accounts.</p>

                    <h4 class="capital-type-title">Debt Capital</h4>
                    <p>A business can acquire capital by borrowing. This is debt capital, and it can
                        be obtained through private or government sources. For established
                        companies, this most often means borrowing from banks and other financial
                        institutions or issuing bonds. For small businesses starting on a
                        shoestring, sources of capital may include friends and family, online
                        lenders, credit card companies, and federal loan programs.</p>
                    <p>Like individuals, businesses must have an active credit history to obtain
                        debt capital. Debt capital requires regular repayment with interest. The
                        interest rates vary depending on the type of capital obtained and the
                        borrower’s credit history.</p>
                    <p>Issuing bonds is a favorite way for corporations to raise debt capital,
                        especially when prevailing interest rates are low, making it cheaper to
                        borrow.</p>

                <div class="capital-type">
                    <h4 class="capital-type-title">Equity Capital</h4>
                    <p>Equity capital can come in several forms. Typically, distinctions are made
                        between private equity, public equity, and real estate equity.</p>
                    <p>Private and public equity will usually be structured in the form of shares of
                        stock in the company. The only distinction here is that public equity is
                        raised by listing the company's shares on a stock exchange while private
                        equity is raised among a closed group of investors.</p>
                    <p>When an individual investor buys shares of stock, they are providing equity
                        capital to a company. The biggest splashes in the world of raising equity
                        capital come, of course, when a company launches an initial public offering
                        (IPO).</p>

                <div class="capital-type">
                    <h4 class="capital-type-title">Working Capital</h4>
                    <p>A company's working capital is its liquid capital assets available for
                        fulfilling daily obligations. It is calculated through the following two
                        assessments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current Assets – Current Liabilities</li>
                        <li>Accounts Receivable + Inventory – Accounts Payable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Working capital measures a company's short-term liquidity. More specifically,
                        it represents its ability to cover its debts, accounts payable, and other
                        obligations that are due within one year.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="capital-type">
                    <h4 class="capital-type-title">Trading Capital</h4>
                    <p>Trading capital is a term used by brokerages and other financial institutions
                        that place a large number of trades daily. Trading capital is the amount of
                        money allotted to an individual or a firm to buy and sell various
                        securities.</p>
                    <p>Investors may attempt to add to their trading capital by employing a variety
                        of trade optimization methods.</p>
                    <p>A big brokerage firm like Charles Schwab or Fidelity Investments will
                        allocate considerable trading capital to each of the professionals who trade
                        stocks and other assets for it.</p>

        <p>Example of Capital in a Business:</p>
        <p>Let's consider a scenario of a small bakery in the Philippines owned by a single
            proprietor. The proprietor initially invests capital of ₱500,000, including cash, baking
            equipment, and raw materials. As the bakery operates, profits increase the capital to
            ₱700,000, while losses decrease it to ₱650,000.</p>
