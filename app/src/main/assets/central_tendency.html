        <h3>Mean (Arithmetic Average):</h3>
        <p>The mean represents the average value of a dataset.</p>
        <p>The mean is the sum of all values in a data set divided by the number of values. It is
            affected by outliers.</p>
        <p>Mathematically, the mean can be expressed as:</p>

        <p>For symmetric data distributions, the mean is accurately located at the center. However,
            in skewed distributions, extreme values can pull the mean away from the center.</p>

        <p>Here are some examples of where the mean is used:</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Descriptive Statistics: The mean is often used to describe the central tendency of a
            set of values. For example, when analyzing test scores of students, the mean score
            can give an idea of the average performance.
        </li>
        <li>Research and Analysis: In research studies, the mean is frequently used to summarize
            data. Researchers often calculate the mean of a sample to draw conclusions about the
            population.
        </li>
        <li>Business and Finance: In finance, the mean is used to calculate averages such as
            stock prices, returns on investments, or company earnings.
        </li>
        <li>Quality Control: In manufacturing processes, the mean is used to monitor and control
            quality by calculating the average measurements of products to ensure they meet
            specifications.
        </li>
        <li>Survey Analysis: When analyzing survey data, the mean can be used to understand the
            average response to a particular question among respondents.
        </li>

        <h3>Median:</h3>
        <p>The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. The median is not affected by
            extreme values and is therefore a better measure than the mean for highly skewed
            distributions.</p>
        <p>If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle
            values.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Dataset with an odd number of observations: 23, 21, 18, 16, 15, 13, 12, 10,
                9,
                7, 6, 5, and 2
            </li>
            <li>Median: 12 (middle value)</li>
            <br>
            <li>2. Dataset with an even number of observations: 40, 38, 35, 33, 32, 30, 29, 27, 26,
                24,
                23, 22, 19, and 17
            </li>
            <li>Median: (27 + 29) / 2 = 28</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Here are some examples of where the median is used:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Income Distribution: In economics, the median income is often used to represent
            the income level that separates the higher half of the population from the lower
            half.
        </li>
        <li>Real Estate: When analyzing housing prices, the median price is often used as it
            represents the middle value of a set of prices, providing a more accurate
            picture of typical prices than the mean.

        </li>
        <li>Healthcare: In healthcare, the median is used to represent the middle value of
            patient outcomes or treatment costs, giving a better understanding of the
            typical result or expense.
        </li>
        <li>Skewed Data: In cases where data is skewed or contains outliers, the median is
            preferred over the mean as it is less affected by extreme values and provides a
            more robust measure of central tendency.
        </li>
        <li>Ranking Data: When ranking items such as salaries, test scores, or performance
            ratings, the median can be used to identify the middle value, which can be more
            representative than the mean in certain situations.
        </li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Mode:</h3>
        <p>The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. There can be one mode,
            more than one mode, or no mode.</p>
        <p>For example, in the dataset {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}, the mode is 2. In the dataset {1, 2, 2, 3,
            3, 4}, the modes are 2 and 3. In the dataset {1, 2, 3, 4}, there is no mode.</p>
        <p> Here are some examples of scenarios where the mode is used:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fashion and Design: Fashion designers use the mode to identify the most popular
                colors, styles, or patterns among consumers.
            </li>
            <li>Education: Teachers can use the mode to determine the most common score on a test,
                helping them assess student performance.
            </li>
            <li>Economics: Economic analysts may calculate the mode of incomes in a population to
                better understand wealth distribution.
            </li>
            <li>Traffic Analysis: Urban planners can use the mode to identify peak traffic hours in
                a specific area.</li>
            <li>Scientific Research: Scientists can use the mode to identify the most frequent
                values in a dataset and draw meaningful conclusions.</li>
