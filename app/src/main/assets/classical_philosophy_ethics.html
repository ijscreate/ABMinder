    <h2>Classical Philosophies and Virtue Ethics</h2>
    <p>The word “ethics” evolved from the Greek word ethos which means “showing moral character.” By
        definition, business ethics refers to the standards for morally right and wrong conduct in
        business. Law partially defines the conduct, but “legal” and “ethical” aren’t necessarily
        the same. Business ethics enhances the law by outlining acceptable behaviors beyond
        government control. Corporations establish business ethics to promote integrity among their
        employees and gain trust from key stakeholders, such as investors and consumers. While
        corporate ethics programs have become common, the quality varies. According to the 2018
        Global Business Ethics Survey (GBES), less than one in four U.S. workers think their company
        has a “well-implemented” ethics program.</p>

    <p>There are three distinct ethical theories: virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and
        consequentialist ethics.</p>

    <h3>Virtue Ethics</h3>
    <p>Virtue Ethics is currently one of three major approaches in normative ethics. It may,
        initially, be identified as the one that emphasizes the virtues, or moral character, in
        contrast to the approach that emphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that emphasizes the
        consequences of actions (consequentialism).</p>

    <h3>Deontological Ethics</h3>
    <p>Deontological ethics in philosophy, ethical theories that place special emphasis on the
        relationship between duty and the morality of human actions. The term deontology is derived
        from the greek deon, “duty,” and logos, “science.”</p>

    <h3>Consequentialism</h3>
    <p>Consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.
        However, the main contention of this branch is what outcomes can be identified as
        objectively desirable.</p>

    <h2>CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHERS</h2>

    <h3>Socrates: dare to disagree</h3>
    <p>Socrates, one of the first philosophers, insisted on our right to think for ourselves. Too
        often, he warned, humans sleepwalk through life, simply going along with the crowd. This is
        dangerous in questions of morality, and particularly in corporate governance. When
        corruption is uncovered, too often people say "everyone else was doing it". But our
        characters are our responsibility. Socrates was prepared to die rather than go against his
        conscience. Does your organization encourage independent thinkers and people who follow
        their conscience? Does it allow people to give critical feedback to managers? Does it create
        opportunities for good people to blow the whistle on bad behavior?</p>

    <h3>Aristotle: let people seek fulfillment</h3>
    <p>Aristotle was a great biologist as well as a great philosopher. He based his ethics on a
        psychological theory of human nature, insisting that we are naturally virtuous, rational,
        social, and happiness-seeking. Governments and organizations need to build the best systems
        to let humans fulfill their natural drives. Aristotle's philosophy was an influence on
        Edward Deci and Richard Ryan's Self-Determination Theory, which suggests that employees will
        work harder for you, and perform better, if you give them tasks, they find meaningful and
        morally worthwhile. Humans want to believe in something and to serve it. Appeal to your
        employees' best nature and they will answer that call.</p>

    <h3>Plutarch: be a good role model</h3>
    <p>Plutarch, the ancient Greek historian, and educator understood that humans are incredibly
        social creatures, who constantly observe the people around them and imitate them.
        Unfortunately, people often grow up surrounded by bad role models. However, we can steer
        people, by providing them with better patterns to imitate. That's what Plutarch tried to do
        with his famous work, Parallel Lives, which offered biographical sketches of some of the
        great Greek and Roman heroes – Cicero, Caesar, Alexander the Great, Pericles – to give young
        people something to emulate. In organizational terms, that means what you say to your
        employees is less important than what you do. They will watch how you behave, how you treat
        others, how you cope with pressure, and whether you follow through on your promises. And
        they will imitate you. If you talk about ethics and then cut corners at the first
        opportunity, they will follow your lead. Set a good example and they will follow it.
        Plutarch would also warn that your best young employees will use you as a bar to aim for and
        exceed. That's natural. Let them compete with you and encourage them to go further.</p>

    <h3>Epictetus: build a resilient mind-set</h3>
    <p>Epictetus grew up as a slave in Rome and then became a Stoic philosopher. Both of these
        positions were incredibly precarious—slaves could be abused or killed by their owners, while
        Stoic philosophers were constantly falling foul of the imperial authorities (Epictetus
        himself was eventually exiled). Epictetus coped with this insecurity by constantly reminding
        himself of what he could control and what he couldn't. We can control our thoughts, beliefs,
        and attitudes, but everything else is to some extent out of our control—other people's
        perceptions and behaviors, the economy, the weather, the future, and the past. If you focus
        on something that is beyond your control and obsesses over it, you will end up feeling
        helpless. Focus on what you can control, and you will feel a measure of autonomy even in
        chaotic situations.</p>

    <h3>Rufus: keep track of your ethical progress</h3>
    <p>Musonius Rufus was known as the Socrates of Rome. He was another Stoic who believed that
        philosophy could not be purely theoretical. If you want to be an ethical individual or an
        ethical company, you can't just study ethics; you have to practice it every day to get into
        good habits. The ancient Greek word for ethics is actually the same word for habit. In
        organizational terms, keeping track of ourselves means trying to take an evidence-based
        assessment of our performance. We might say we're a green company, but how do we know if
        we're making progress? We might say we're a eudemonic organization, but how do we know? We
        can keep track of this, for example, by asking our employees (anonymously) how worthwhile
        they feel their job is. Then see if, in a year, we have managed to enhance their sense of
        purpose.</p>

    <h3>Epicurus: the art of happiness</h3>
    <p>Epicurus was a fourth-century Greek philosopher who taught, rather scandalously, that the aim
        of life was simply to be as happy as possible here on Earth before we die and dissolve back
        into the atomic universe. He warned that humans are very bad at being happy and very good at
        inventing reasons to be miserable. He suggested that philosophy should teach us how to be
        happy. For example, it could teach us how to bring our attention to the present moment and
        savor it. It could also teach us to limit our desires to what is easy to get, not inflate
        our needs with endless, artificially stimulated desires. Today, some companies are embracing
        Epicurus' philosophy and trying to teach their employees the art of happiness. Tony Hsieh,
        the CEO of American shoe company Zappos, is so committed to the company's courses in
        happiness that he sold the company to Amazon on the agreement that it would be able to
        continue with its unique happy culture.</p>
