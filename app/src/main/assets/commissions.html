<h2>Commissions</h2>

<p>Commission, in a financial context, refers to the fee that a salesperson or broker earns when
    they facilitate a transaction, such as the buying or selling of a financial security or real
    estate property.</p>

<h3>Understanding Commission</h3>
<p>Commission is a common form of compensation used in various industries, including the financial
    sector, real estate, and sales. It serves as an incentive for individuals to generate revenue by
    closing deals or completing transactions.</p>
<p>A commission is a fee or payment made to someone in exchange for services rendered or sales made.
    It is commonly used in sales, real estate, and other industries where individuals or agents earn
    a percentage of the value of the goods or services they sell. For example, in real estate sales,
    a broker may receive a commission as a percentage of the sale price of a property. Similarly, in
    product sales, salespeople may earn a commission based on the total value of sales they make.
    Commissions are a way to incentivize and reward performance of individuals involved in
    commercial transactions. They can vary in terms of percentage and are usually agreed upon in
    advance between the parties involved.</p>

<h3>Nine Types of Sales Commission Structures</h3>
<p>There are a variety of sales commission structures that businesses use depending on their
    services or products. The nine most common structures include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Base rate only commission</strong><br>
        The base rate only plan pays sales representatives an hourly or flat salary. This commission
        structure benefits businesses where salespeople spend a lot of time educating and supporting
        customers before and after sales. There’s no incentive to upsell or sell more products or
        services.<br>
        Example: The company’s four salespeople each earn $1,250 a week no matter how many sales
        they make.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Base salary plus commission</strong><br>
        The base salary plus plan is one of the most common commission structures. It provides
        salespeople with an hourly or straight base salary plus a commission rate. Typically, the
        base salary is often too low to support someone's income entirely but it does provide a
        guaranteed income when sales are low. The standard salary to commission ratio is 60:40 with
        60% being the base rate and 40% being commission-driven. The plan best serves as an
        incentive or motivation for increased sales performance.<br>
        Example: A salesperson earns $500 a month in salary with 10% commission, or $500, for $5,000
        worth in sales. If he sells $20,000 of product in one month, he earns $2,500: $500 in salary
        and $2,000 in commission.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Draw against a commission</strong><br>
        The commission draw plan is based on an advance payment, or draw, that helps new hires
        acclimate to their sales roles without losing income. It incorporates elements of the
        commission-only and base pay plus commission structures. The more you sell, the more you
        make in commissions.<br>
        Sales representatives earn a salary, or draw, each month for a specified time regardless of
        sales. If they earn less in commission than they do in salary, they keep the commission and
        the difference between it and the draw amount. The funds are considered advanced payments
        until commissions reach or exceed the salary draw. These advanced payments must be paid back
        eventually to employers. The salesperson only profits if commission totals are higher than
        the draw amount.<br>
        Example: A salesperson is expected to earn $4,000 a month in commission and receives $2,000
        a month in draw. If they met their $4,000 goal, they earn $2,000 more, the amount over the
        draw. If they earn only $1,000, they owe the company $1,000, the amount under the draw.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Gross margin commission</strong><br>
        The gross margin commission model factors in expenses involved with the products being sold.
        The salesperson earns a percentage of the profit. Because their commission depends on the
        final cost of the sale, salespeople are less likely to discount products. The more they can
        upsell a product or service, the more commission they can earn.<br>
        Example: A salesperson is selling a $100,000 car that costs $60,000 to make. The gross
        margin is $40,000. The salesperson earns 5% on the margin or $2,000 in compensation.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Residual commission</strong><br>
        The residual plan benefits salespeople with ongoing accounts or clients. As accounts
        continue to generate revenue, commission payments continue. The structure encourages
        salespeople to retain their customers or develop repeat business. This structure is most
        common in agencies and consulting firms that handle long-term accounts.<br>
        Example: An insurance salesperson lands a large account. As long as that company pays its
        premiums of $3,000 a month, the salesperson receives a 5% commission or $150 each month.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Revenue commission</strong><br>
        Companies more concerned with larger business goals than total profit commonly use the
        revenue commission model when setting commission rates. Sales representatives who earn a
        predetermined percentage of the revenue they generate have the opportunity to become top
        sales performers.<br>
        Example: A car salesperson sells a $25,000 vehicle and earns 3% of the sales. They receive
        $750 in revenue commission for that sale.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Straight commission</strong><br>
        Salespeople who work on straight commission only earn money when they complete a sale. No
        sale equals no income. Since the company doesn’t provide a base salary, it can offer higher
        commission rates which often attracts the best salespeople. The straight commission
        structure allows salespeople to function like independent contractors who set their own
        hours, which saves companies money in taxes, benefits and other expenses. The company is out
        money only when the salesperson brings in revenue.<br>
        Example: A telemarket that sells vacation condo rentals earns $150 for every booking. The
        more time put in on the phone, the greater the chance of making a sale.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tiered commission</strong><br>
        In the tiered commission model, salespeople earn a certain percentage of commission on all
        sales up to a designated amount. Once they achieve their revenue goal, their commission
        increases. This encourages them to exceed sales goals and close more deals.<br>
        Example: A salesperson's base commission is 5% up to a total of $100,000 in sales. That
        commission increases to 7% for total sales between $100,001 and $200,000. Any sales over
        $200,001 earn them 10% in commission.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Territory volume commission</strong><br>
        In this model, salespeople earn their income based on the set rate for their defined region.
        The amount of compensation typically depends on territory volume, where sales numbers are
        totaled and commissions split equally among salespeople within the region. This compensation
        plan will only work for sales representatives who work in a team-oriented environment.<br>
        Example: Two salespeople are expected to sell $50,000 in product each month in a 100-mile
        region. One sells $30,000 while the co-worker sells $20,000. Since the total goal has been
        met, they split the 10% commission, earning $2,500 each.
    </li>

<div class="scenario">
    <p>Let's consider an example scenario to illustrate a commission.</p>
    <h3>Scenario: Multi-Agent Real Estate Transaction with Variable Commission Structures</h3>

    <h4>Background:</h4>
    <p>You are part of a real estate agency in Metro Manila, Philippines. The agency specializes in
        luxury properties, catering to high-net-worth clients. Recently, a prestigious client
        expressed interest in purchasing a high-end penthouse in the heart of Makati City.</p>

    <h4>Details:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Property Type:</strong> Luxury Penthouse</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Makati City, Metro Manila</li>
        <li><strong>Sale Price:</strong> ₱50,000,000</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Players:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Client (Buyer):</strong> A successful entrepreneur seeking a luxurious urban
            retreat.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Seller (Property Owner):</strong> The owner of the penthouse, a prominent
            business tycoon.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Real Estate Agents:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agent A (Listing Agent):</strong> You, the listing agent responsible for
                    marketing and selling the penthouse.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Agent B (Buyer’s Agent):</strong> Your colleague, representing the
                    buyer’s interests.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Commission Agreements:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Agent A (Listing Agent):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>You have an exclusive listing agreement with the seller. Your commission rate is
                    5% of the final sale price.
                </li>
                <li>If you sell the penthouse directly to the client, your commission would be:</li>
                <li>Commission (Agent A) = 0.05 × ₱50,000,000 = ₱2,500,000.</li>
                <li>However, you’re open to collaborating with other agents to expedite the sale.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Agent B (Buyer’s Agent):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Agent B represents the buyer and has a separate agreement.</li>
                <li>Their commission structure is tiered:</li>
                <li>First ₱10,000,000: 3% commission</li>
                <li>Next ₱20,000,000: 2% commission</li>
                <li>Remaining ₱20,000,000: 1% commission</li>
                <li>If Agent B successfully brings the buyer and closes the deal, their commission
                    would be:
                </li>
                <li>Commission (Agent B) = (0.03 × ₱10,000,000) + (0.02 × ₱20,000,000) + (0.01 ×
                    ₱20,000,000) = ₱700,000.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Negotiations and Collaboration:</h4>
    <p>Agent A and Agent B decide to collaborate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agent A introduces the penthouse to the client.</li>
        <li>Agent B accompanies the client during property viewings and negotiations.</li>
        <li>They work together to address the client’s specific requirements.</li>
        <li>The client is impressed by the seamless teamwork.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Outcome:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The client falls in love with the penthouse and decides to purchase it.</li>
        <li>The final sale price remains ₱50,000,000.</li>
        <li>The commission distribution:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Agent A (Listing Agent): ₱2,500,000</li>
            <li>Agent B (Buyer’s Agent): ₱700,000</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Factors Affecting Sales Commission Rates</h3>
<p>There are several factors that can affect the sales commission rate:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Different industries may offer different commission rates based
        on market dynamics and profit margins.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Company Size:</strong> Larger companies may offer higher commission rates to attract
        top talent.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Experience and Performance:</strong> Experienced and high-performing salespeople may
        negotiate higher commission rates.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sales Targets:</strong> Commission rates may be tied to specific sales targets or
        performance metrics.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>It's important to note that sales commission rates are just one component of a salesperson's
    total compensation. Other components include base salary, bonuses, and benefits. Therefore, it's
    essential to consider the total compensation package when evaluating a sales job offer.</p>
