    <h2>Common Practices in Business Organizations</h2>
    <p>Business organizations establish policies and procedures to govern their operations and
        protect stakeholders' interests. These policies serve as guidelines for conducting business
        and ensuring best practices. Here are some common examples of good policies that
        organizations adopt:</p>

    <h3>Software Updates</h3>
    <p>Keeping software up-to-date is crucial for protecting against cyber threats. Organizations
        should regularly update all software across the company to prevent vulnerabilities that
        hackers could exploit.</p>

    <h3>Employee Engagement</h3>
    <p>Fostering a sense of unity and purpose among employees is essential for their enthusiasm and
        productivity. Managers should strive to align employees with the company's values and
        objectives, making them care about the business goals.</p>

    <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
    <p>A clear code of conduct outlines expected standards of performance and workplace behavior. It
        promotes a culture of respect, good performance, and provides a structured process for
        addressing grievances and disciplinary issues fairly.</p>

    <h3>Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Equal opportunity policies promote fair treatment and prevent discrimination based on race,
        gender, sexual orientation, religion, or cultural beliefs. Companies should advocate for
        anti-discriminatory practices and encourage an unprejudiced work environment.</p>

    <h3>Attendance and Time Off</h3>
    <p>An attendance policy outlines rules related to employee absences, such as sick leave, casual
        leave, vacation leave, and other authorized leaves. It specifies eligibility criteria,
        application procedures, and consequences for excessive absenteeism or falsification of
        attendance records.</p>

    <h3>Non-Competition Agreements</h3>
    <p>A non-compete agreement prohibits employees from engaging in competition with their former
        employer or revealing proprietary information after their employment ends. These agreements
        may have a specified duration and can apply to employees, contractors, and consultants.</p>

    <h3>Finance and Accounting Policies</h3>
    <p>Accounting policies are the principles and procedures implemented by a company's management
        to prepare financial statements. They include accounting methods, measurement systems, and
        disclosure requirements, adhering to generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

    <p>By adopting these and other good policies, organizations can establish a positive work
        environment, promote ethical conduct, protect their interests, and foster long-term
        success.</p>
