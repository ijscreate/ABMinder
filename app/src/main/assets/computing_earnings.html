    <h2>Gross Profit vs Net Income</h2>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Gross profit and net income are two important financial metrics used to assess the
        performance of a business. While both are indicators of profitability, they represent
        different aspects of a company's financial health.</p>

    <h4>Related Terms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> These are the costs associated with running a
            company's day-to-day operations, such as rent, utilities, salaries, and marketing
            expenses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> COGS represents the direct costs incurred by
            a company to produce goods or services that are sold to customers. It includes material
            costs, labor costs, and overhead expenses directly related to production.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Profit Margin:</strong> Profit margin is a financial metric that measures the
            profitability of a company by comparing its net income to its total revenue. It
            indicates how efficiently a company is generating profits from its operations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and
            Amortization):</strong> EBITDA is a measure of a company's operating performance and is
            used to evaluate its profitability without the influence of non-operating expenses,
            financing costs, or accounting practices.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Revenue, also known as sales or turnover, is the total amount
            of money generated by a company from its business activities, such as selling products
            or services to customers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gross Profit</h3>
    <p>Gross income, also known as gross pay or gross earnings, refers to the total income earned by
        an individual before any deductions or taxes are subtracted. It represents the total amount
        of money received from all sources of income, including wages, salaries, bonuses, tips,
        commissions, rental income, and any other forms of earnings. <br>
        <br>
        Gross income includes both taxable and non-taxable income and is typically stated as an
        annual figure. It is important to note that gross income does not reflect the amount of
        money an individual takes home or their net income, as it does not consider deductions such
        as taxes, insurance premiums, retirement contributions, or other withholdings. <br>
        <br>
        Gross income serves as the starting point for determining an individual's taxable income. It
        is reported on tax returns and is used as the basis for calculating the amount of income tax
        owed to the government.</p>

    <div>
        <p>For example, John’s job as a marketing executive provides him with a base salary of ₱60,000 per year.
            This amount is distributed to him in equal monthly payments, resulting in a pre-tax
            monthly income of ₱5,000 (₱60,000 / 12 months).</p>
        <p>In addition to his salary, John receives an annual performance bonus of ₱5,000. This
            bonus is typically given at the end of the fiscal year to acknowledge his outstanding
            work and accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Moreover, John owns a property that yields rental income. His property, a small
            apartment, is rented out for ₱1,500 per month, leading to an annual rental income of
            ₱18,000.</p>
        <p>To compute John’s gross income, we sum up all his income sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Salary: ₱60,000 per year (₱5,000 per month)</li>
            <li>Bonus: ₱5,000</li>
            <li>Rental income: ₱18,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total gross income = ₱60,000 + ₱5,000 + ₱18,000 = ₱83,000 per year</p>
        <p>So, John’s gross income is ₱83,000 annually. This represents the total amount he earns
            before any taxes or deductions are applied.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that gross income can fluctuate based on an individual’s
            situation. Other factors that can influence gross income include additional income
            sources, such as part-time jobs, freelance work, investments, or dividends. Furthermore,
            elements like overtime pay, commissions, or tips can also add to an individual’s gross
            income.</p>
        <p>Calculating gross income is vital for tax purposes, as it assists in determining an
            individual’s taxable income and ensures accurate reporting and adherence to tax
            laws.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Let's consider another example.</p>
        <p>Revenue Streams:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread sales: ₱1,000,000 per year</li>
            <li>Pastry sales: ₱800,000 per year</li>
            <li>Catering services: ₱200,000 per year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ingredients cost: ₱400,000 per year</li>
            <li>Packaging cost: ₱100,000 per year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To calculate the gross income for Sunshine Bakery, we subtract the COGS from the total
            revenue:</p>
        <p>Total Revenue = Bread sales + Pastry sales + Catering services</p>
        <p>Total Revenue = ₱1,000,000 + ₱800,000 + ₱200,000 = ₱2,000,000</p>
        <p>COGS = Ingredients cost + Packaging cost</p>
        <p>COGS = ₱400,000 + ₱100,000 = ₱500,000</p>
        <p>Now, we can calculate the Gross Income:</p>
        <p>Gross Income = Total Revenue - COGS</p>
        <p>Gross Income = ₱2,000,000 - ₱500,000 = ₱1,500,000</p>
        <p>So, the gross income for Sunshine Bakery is ₱1,500,000 per year. This represents the
            total profit the bakery makes before any other expenses (like rent, salaries, utilities)
            are deducted. It’s a measure of the bakery’s efficiency in turning raw ingredients into
            profitable baked goods. Remember, the higher the gross income, the more efficient the
            business is considered to be.</p>

    <h3>Net Income</h3>
    <p>Net income, also known as net earnings or net profit, refers to the amount of money an
        individual or business has after deducting all applicable expenses from their gross income.
        It represents the actual income or profit that remains after accounting for various costs,
        such as taxes, operating expenses, interest payments, and other deductions. <br>
        <br>
        Net income is a crucial financial indicator as it provides insight into the overall
        profitability of an individual or business. It is often reported on income statements or
        financial statements and is used to assess the financial performance and profitability of an
        entity. <br>
        <br>
        For individuals, net income is often referred to as take-home pay or disposable income, as
        it represents the amount of money available for personal spending, savings, investments, or
        other financial goals. <br>
        <br>
        For businesses, net income is a key metric for evaluating financial performance, shareholder
        returns, and determining the overall health and profitability of the organization. <br>
        <br>
        It's important to note that net income may also include other items like non-recurring gains
        or losses, dividends, and other income streams specific to an individual or business.</p>

            </annotation>
        </semantics>
    </math>

    <p>Let’s continue with the Sunshine Bakery example for calculating net income:</p>
    <p>Gross income:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>₱1,500,000 (as calculated previously)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Operating Expenses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rent: ₱300,000 per year</li>
        <li>Salaries: ₱500,000 per year</li>
        <li>Utilities: ₱100,000 per year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> ₱50,000 per year (on business loans)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taxes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>₱200,000 per year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To calculate the net income for Sunshine Bakery, we subtract the operating expenses,
        interest, and taxes from the gross income:</p>
    <p>Operating Expenses = Rent + Salaries + Utilities <br> Operating Expenses = ₱300,000 + ₱500,000 +
        ₱100,000 = ₱900,000</p>
    <p>Now, we can calculate the Net Income:</p>
    <p>Net Income = Gross Income - Operating Expenses - Interest - Taxes <br> Net Income = ₱1,500,000 -
        ₱900,000 - ₱50,000 - ₱200,000 = ₱350,000</p>
    <p>So, the net income for Sunshine Bakery is ₱350,000 per year. This represents the total profit
        the bakery makes after all expenses are deducted. It’s a measure of the bakery’s overall
        profitability after accounting for all costs. Remember, the higher the net income, the more
        profitable the business is considered to be.</p>
