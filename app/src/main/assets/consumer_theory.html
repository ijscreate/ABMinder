        <h2>Consumer Theory: Definition, Significance, and Application</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h3>Understanding Consumer Theory</h3>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Consumer theory focuses on how individuals allocate their
            income to maximize utility, considering their preferences and budget limitations.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Elements:</strong> It involves predicting consumer choices by assuming
            rational decision-making based on maximizing utility within budget constraints.</p>
        <p><strong>Utility Maximization:</strong> Consumers are assumed to make choices that bring
            them the greatest benefit or satisfaction, known as utility maximization.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of Consumer Theory</h3>
        <p><strong>Economic Insights:</strong> Understanding consumer behavior aids in predicting
            market demand, shaping pricing strategies, and optimizing resource allocation.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Strategy:</strong> Helps businesses tailor products and services to meet
            consumer preferences, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Market Dynamics:</strong> Consumer theory provides a framework for analyzing
            demand curves, pricing strategies, and the impact of income levels on purchasing
            decisions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Application of Consumer Theory</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Budget Constraints:</strong> Consumers face limitations on spending due to
                their income levels. Consumer theory helps in analyzing how individuals allocate
                their budgets across different goods and services.</p>
            <p><strong>Utility Maximization:</strong> By assuming that consumers aim to maximize
                their satisfaction (utility) within budget constraints, businesses can predict
                consumer choices and tailor offerings accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>Demand Analysis:</strong> Consumer theory aids in understanding demand
                curves, price elasticity, and factors influencing consumer preferences, guiding
                businesses in strategic decision-making.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Shortcomings of Consumer Theory</h3>
        <p><strong>Irrationality:</strong> People do not always make rational choices due to
            emotional factors or changing preferences, which can challenge the assumptions of
            consumer theory.</p>
        <p><strong>Simplifying Assumptions:</strong> To overcome limitations like irrationality or
            changing preferences, consumer theory often relies on simplifying assumptions that may
            not always reflect real-world complexities.</p>

            <h3>Example of Consumer Theory Application</h3>
        </header>
        <section>
            <h4>Sam's Consumption Preferences</h4>
            <p><strong>Sam consumes only green eggs and ham.</strong> Green eggs cost &#8369;100
                each, while ham costs &#8369;300. Sam's utility function is Utility = 10QG + 40QH,
                where QG and QH represent the quantities of green eggs and ham consumed.</p>
            <p><strong>Budget Constraint:</strong> Sam's income is &#8369;1800. To illustrate this,
                we draw a graph with ham on the horizontal axis and plot Sam's budget constraint
                based on his income and the prices of green eggs and ham.</p>
            <p><strong>Preferences:</strong> Sam's utility function indicates that he values ham
                more than green eggs, as the coefficient for ham consumption is higher. This
                suggests that Sam's preferences are not for perfect substitutes or fixed proportions
                but feature diminishing marginal rate of substitution between green eggs and ham.

            <h4>Jill's Skiing Preferences</h4>
            <p><strong>Jill loves skiing and has &#8369;4000 to spend on ski rentals (&#8369;200/day)
                and lift passes (&#8369;800/day) this winter.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Budget Constraint:</strong> Drawing a graph with ski rental days on one axis
                and lift pass days on the other, we can illustrate Jill's budget constraint based on
                her income and the prices of ski rentals and lift passes.</p>
            <p><strong>Optimal Consumption Bundle:</strong> Jill's optimal consumption bundle will
                be determined by maximizing her utility within budget constraints, balancing the
                number of ski rental days and lift pass days to achieve the highest satisfaction
                level.</p>
