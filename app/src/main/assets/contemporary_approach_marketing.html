<h2>CONTEMPORARY APPROACH TO MARKETING</h2>

<p>The focal point of the contemporary approach to marketing is geared towards the customer and
    their needs with regards to the product and the services. In short, the contemporary approach to
    marketing is more focused on customers, rather than seeking to pull customers to a product,
    whatever the cost (traditional approaches). Oftentimes, contemporary marketing approaches use
    many strategies to build a relationship with their clients.</p>

<h3>Difference between Contemporary Marketing Orientation and Traditional Marketing
    Orientation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The main difference between the contemporary marketing orientation and traditional marketing
        orientation is that while the former is consumer-focused, the latter is company-focused.
    </li>
    <li>Traditional marketing is concerned with pulling customers and does not really consider the
        customer's diverse needs. Rather, it is concerned with the market or industry in which the
        company operates.
    </li>
    <li>Contemporary marketing aims for customer satisfaction in order to build a relationship.
        Therefore, the types of marketing strategies under contemporary marketing are concerned with
        fulfilling the needs of customers.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Contemporary Approaches to Marketing:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Relationship Marketing</strong><br>
        Relationship marketing approach helps businesses build a strong connection with their
        clients. This, in turn, helps businesses create lifelong bonds with their loyal customers.
        The need to maintain and establish relationships with customers these days is highly
        important because it not only helps them understand their audience in the long-run, but also
        reduces the amount needed to generate new sales compared to traditional marketing
        approaches.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Industrial Marketing</strong><br>
        Also known as business-to-business marketing (B2B), Industrial Marketing is a branch of
        marketing that involves one business dealing with another business. Rather than targeting
        their customers, the businesses are targeting other businesses in this type of marketing. If
        the industrial buyers are satisfied with their products and services (including price),
        long-term relations can be created. However, it is good to note that since there are fewer
        businesses in comparison to consumers in general, the total number of business buyers will
        be less.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Social Marketing</strong><br>
        Social marketing is a branch of marketing that attempts to bring social change in a
        community or globally. It combines marketing strategies and theories with other plans to
        achieve social change. This branch of marketing seeks to benefit individuals and different
        communities. The goal of social advertising campaigns is to promote ideas that either
        encourage positive behaviors like caring for the environment or discourage negative
        behaviors, such as speeding or smoking in public areas. In this way, social marketing
        “sells” the well-being of society as a whole.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Contemporary Social Marketing Approaches followed by organizations:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cause Marketing – It is the type of marketing in which a company and charity team up
        together and spread awareness for a good cause. If the campaign is successful, it can help
        in increasing the business value for the company.
    </li>
    <li>Event Marketing – It is the type of marketing in which marketers conduct promotional events
        and promote their products and services in those events. This involves face-to-face contact
        and helps in increasing the credibility of the brand.
    </li>
    <li>Green Marketing – It is the practice of marketing in which the services and goods are
        marketed from their environmental benefits. Research has shown that the customers are
        willing to pay extra for products from companies which are concerned about the environment
        and committed to sustainable development.
    </li>
</ol>

        unified brand experience and meet customer expectations at every stage of the buyer's
        journey.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Global Marketing Strategy:</strong> A global marketing strategy involves adapting
        marketing tactics and messaging to suit diverse international markets while maintaining a
        consistent brand identity. This approach considers cultural, linguistic, regulatory, and
        economic differences to effectively reach and resonate with audiences worldwide.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data:</strong> AI and big data technologies
        enable marketers to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of data to gain actionable
        insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and trends. By leveraging AI-driven algorithms
        and machine learning models, businesses can personalize marketing efforts, optimize
        targeting and messaging, and improve overall campaign performance.
