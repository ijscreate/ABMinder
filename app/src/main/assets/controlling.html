    <h2>CONTROLLING</h2>
    <h3>Specific Learning Outcome:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Know the definition and nature of management control</li>
        <li>Discuss the role of budget in planning and control</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p>Control is the process of comparing actual performance with established standards for the
        purpose of taking action to correct deviations. A system of controls presupposes the
        existence of certain standards. The plans provide the standards of performance which serve
        as the basis of controls. Controlling helps an organization to put its resources to best
        use, bring order and discipline throughout the organization, facilitate coordination of
        activities and cope with uncertainty and change, quite effectively.</p>
    <p>The process of controls involves four steps: establishment of standards, measurement of
        actual performance, comparison of actual performance with the standards and taking
        corrective action when required.</p>
    <p>Effective controls systems tend to have certain qualities in common. The controls system
        should be simple, suitable, economical, reasonably flexible, forward looking, achievable,
        objective and acceptable.</p>
    <p>Depending on the time at which controlled is exercised, controls may be classified into three
        categories: feedback control, concurrent control, and feedforward control. In a large
        organization, it is not possible to control everything. So, usually, a multiproduct firm
        puts attention on key result areas through a critical or strategic point control system.
        Management by exception is another technique when attention is drawn towards unusual or
        exceptional items only.</p>
    <p>While controlling the human element, management should be careful enough not to rub people on
        the wrong side. The feelings, aspirations and attitudes of employees must be given weight
        while devising quantitative standards. Top management must find ways and means to strike a
        proper balance between persons, standards, and organizational objectives.</p>

    <h2>Control Defined</h2>
    <p>Control is an important function of management. It is an essential feature of scientific
        management. In fact, much of the precision of managerial education is focused on the
        improvement of control techniques.</p>
    <p>The term ‘control’ may have controlled sensitive connotation due to its non-standardized use
        in diverse fields. It is generally used for putting restraints on the elements being
        controlled. It is also used for providing information and data for appropriate actions such
        as controls room of a railway station or shipyard. In managerial terminology, controls is
        ensuring work accomplishment according to plans. Thus, basically, control is a process that
        guides activity towards some predetermined goal.</p>
    <p>The following are some important definitions of controls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>“In undertaking controls consists in verifying whether everything occurs in
                conformity with the plans adopted, the instructions issued and the principle
                established. Its object is to point out the weakness and error in order to rectify
                them and prevent the occurrence. It operates on everything, i.e., things, people,
                and action.” - H. Fall</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>“Control is checking current performance against predetermined standards constrained
                in the plans, with a view to ensuring adequate progress and satisfactory
                performance.” - F.F.L. Breach</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>“Controls, in its managerial sense, can be defined as, the presence in a business of
                that force which guides it to a predetermined objective by means of predetermined
                policies and decision.” - Dalton E. McFarland</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, we see that control is a fundamental management function that ensures work
        accomplishment according to plans. It is concerned with measuring and evaluating performance
        so as to secure the best results of managerial efforts.</p>
    <h3>Nature of Control</h3>
    <p>Managerial controls has the following characteristics:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Control is a function of management: It is, in fact, a follow-up action to the other
            functions of management. This function is performed by all the managers in the
            organization to control the activities assigned to them.
        </li>
        <li>Control is a dynamic process: It involves the continuous review of standards of
            performance and results in corrective action which may lead to changes in other
            functions of management.
        </li>
        <li>Control is a continuous activity: It does not stop anywhere. According to Koontz and
            O’Donnell “Just as the navigator continually takes readings to ascertain the right
            course so should be the business manager continually take readings to assure himself
            that his enterprise or department is of the course.”
        </li>
        <li>Controls is forward-looking: It is related to future, as the past cannot be controlled.
            It is usually preventive as the presence of controls systems leads to minimize wastages,
            losses, and deviations from standards. It should be noted that controls do not curtail
            the rights of the individuals. It simply keeps a check on the performance of
            individuals.
        </li>
        <li>Planning and controlling are closely related with each other: According to Billy E.
            Goetz, ‘Managerial Planning seeks consistent, integrated and articulated program while
            managerial control seeks to compel events to conform to plans. As a matter of fact,
            planning is based on control and control is based on planning. The process of controls
            uses certain standards for measuring performance which is laid down by planning. The
            controls process, in turn, may reveal the deficiency of planning and may lead to the
            revision of planning. It may also lead to the setting of new goals, change the
            organizational structure, improve staffing and make major changes in the techniques of
            directing.
        </li>
        <li>The essence of control is action: The performance of controls is achieved only when
            corrective action is taken on the basis of feedback information. It is only action which
            adjusts performance to predetermined standards whenever deviations occur. A good system
            of controls facilitates timely action so that there is the minimum waste of time and
            energy.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Planning and Controlling</h3>
    <p>Planning and controlling are inseparable twins of management. Planning and controlling
        functions always co-exist or have to exist together as one function depends on the other.
        Planning decides the control process and controlling provides a sound basis for planning. In
        simple words, planning and controlling are basically dependent on each other.</p>
    <h4>Planning Originates Controlling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In planning, the objectives or targets are set in order to achieve these targets control
            process is needed. So planning precedes control.
        </li>
        <li>Controlling Sustains Planning: Controlling directs the course of planning. Controlling
            spots the areas where planning is required.
        </li>
        <li>Controlling Provides Information for Planning: In controlling, the actual performance is
            compared to the standards set and records the deviations, if any. The information
            collected for exercising control is used for planning also.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Planning and Controlling are Interrelated:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning is the first function of management. The other functions like organizing,
            staffing, directing etc. are organized for implementing plans. Control records the
            actual performance and compares it with standards set. In case the performance is less
            than that of standards set then deviations are ascertained. Proper corrective measures
            are taken to improve the performance in future. Planning is the first function and
            control is the last one. Both are dependent upon each other.
        </li>
        <li>Planning and Control are Forward Looking: Planning and control are concerned with the
            future activities of the business. Planning is always for the future and control is also
            forward-looking. No one can control the past, it is the future which can be controlled.
            Planning and controlling are concerned with the achievement of business goals. Their
            combined efforts are to reach maximum output with a minimum of cost. Both systematic
            planning and organized controls are essential to achieve the organizational goals.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Role of Budgeting In the Management Process: Planning and Control</h3>
    <p>This paper is a literature review on management accounting and it examines the necessity and
        the role of budgeting and budget controlling in the management process. Budgets are
        necessary to highlight the financial implications of plans, to define the resources required
        to achieve these plans and to provide a means of measuring, viewing, and controlling the
        obtained results, in comparison with the plans.</p>
    <p>Many managers, especially those familiar with accounting, criticize budgets, saying that this
        implies additional consumption of effort and waste of time, claiming that there are too many
        estimates in the budget and that these estimations are unreliable, for it to be useful. And
        yet, any large company prepares budgets. Why? Because it forces managers to foresee, to
        study trends and develop necessary strategies.</p>
    <p>Also, the budget can prevent imminent issues. Budgets are excellent communication tools,
        pointing out the operational and financial objectives of the period. Budgets communicate to
        the upper and middle management which are the top-management’s expectations, and also
        communicate the management’s priorities to the lower levels. In some cases, it can give a
        manager the authority to dispose of certain funds, but being limited by the budget.
        Furthermore, the budget sets the prices for internal services and is the basis for
        performance evaluation.</p>
    <p>The controlling function confirms or not the compliance or noncompliance of the results with
        the predetermined objectives, highlighting occurred deviations and the causes that produced
        them. Budget controlling compares costs, revenues, and actual performance with the budget so
        that, if necessary, it can be reviewed and corrective measures can be applied. This paper
        also includes a case study in a Romanian company and the collected data will be valued and
        interpreted in detail.</p>
    <p>Not all managers in our country understand the importance of budgeting. The aim of this study
        is to demonstrate the necessity of budgets in planning and controlling of a company’s
        activity.</p>
