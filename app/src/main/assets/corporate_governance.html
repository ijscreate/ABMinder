<h1>Corporate Governance: Principles and Practices</h1>

<p>
    Corporate governance refers to the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company
    is directed and controlled. It involves balancing the interests of various stakeholders, such as

    Effective corporate governance ensures ethical business conduct, transparency, and
    accountability, contributing to the long-term success of the organization.

<h2>Understanding Corporate Governance</h2>

    shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance.
</p>
<p>Communicating a company's corporate governance is a key component of community and investor
    relations. For instance, Apple Inc.'s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership
    (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters
    and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of
    incorporation.

<p>Most successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders,
    it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate
    citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate
    governance practices.
