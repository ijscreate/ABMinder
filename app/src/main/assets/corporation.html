        <p>A corporation is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners.
            Corporations enjoy most of the rights and responsibilities that individuals possess:
            they can enter contracts, loan and borrow money, sue and be sued, hire employees, own
            assets, and pay taxes. Some refer to it as a "legal person."</p>
        <h3>Characteristics of a Corporation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal entity:</strong> A corporation is a separate legal entity from its
                owners, meaning it can enter into contracts, sue, and be sued in its own name.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Limited liability:</strong> Shareholders are typically not personally liable
                for the debts and obligations of the corporation. Their liability is limited to the
                amount of their investment.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Perpetual existence:</strong> A corporation has a continuous existence, even
                if its owners or shareholders change. Its existence is not dependent on the lives of
                its owners.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Centralized management:</strong> Corporations are managed by a board of
                directors elected by shareholders. Day-to-day operations are typically overseen by
                officers appointed by the board.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transferable ownership:</strong> Ownership interests in a corporation,
                typically in the form of stock, can be easily transferred between shareholders.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of a Corporation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited Liability: Shareholders of a corporation have limited liability, meaning
                they are not personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the
                corporation. This means that their personal assets are protected in the event of
                bankruptcy or legal issues.
            </li>
            <li>Access to Capital: Corporations can raise capital through the sale of stocks and
                bonds, providing them with access to larger amounts of capital than other business
                structures.
            </li>
            <li>Perpetual Existence: Corporations have perpetual existence, meaning they continue to
                exist even if the ownership changes. This provides stability and continuity to the
                business.
            </li>
            <li>Ability to attract and retain employees through stock options and other incentives
            </li>
            <li>Transferability of Ownership: Ownership in a corporation can be easily transferred
                through the sale of stocks, providing flexibility to shareholders who want to sell
                their ownership or to new investors who want to buy in.
            </li>
            <li>Tax Benefits: Corporations may enjoy tax benefits, such as the ability to deduct
                business expenses and the lower tax rate on corporate income.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of a Corporation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Double Taxation: Corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning the
                corporation is taxed on its income, and shareholders are taxed on their dividends.
            </li>
            <li>Cost and Complexity: Corporations are more costly and complex to set up and maintain
                than other business structures, requiring more legal and accounting services.
            </li>
            <li>Government Regulation: Corporations are subject to more government regulation and
                oversight than other business structures, including securities regulations and
                reporting requirements.
            </li>
            <li>Shareholder Expectations: Corporations have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the
                best interest of the shareholders, which can sometimes conflict with the interests
                of other stakeholders, such as employees or the community.
            </li>
            <li>Lack of Privacy: Corporations are required to disclose more information to the
                public than other business structures, reducing privacy for the owners.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) is a well-known corporation in the Philippines. It
                is the largest fast-food chain in the country and one of the largest in Asia, with
                over 3,200 stores worldwide. JFC was established in 1975 as a family-owned business
                and was incorporated as a corporation in 1978.</p>
            <p>As a corporation, JFC has a separate legal personality from its shareholders,
                providing limited liability protection to its shareholders. This means that the
                shareholders are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the
                corporation, and their personal assets are protected in the event of bankruptcy or
                legal issues.</p>
            <p>JFC has access to a large amount of capital through the sale of stocks and bonds,
                allowing it to expand its operations and open new stores both domestically and
                internationally. The corporation's ownership is easily transferable through the sale
                of stocks, providing flexibility to shareholders who want to sell their ownership or
                to new investors who want to buy in.</p>
            <p>JFC is subject to double taxation, meaning the corporation is taxed on its income,
                and shareholders are taxed on their dividends. However, the corporation enjoys tax
                benefits, such as the ability to deduct business expenses and the lower tax rate on
                corporate income.</p>
            <p>JFC is also subject to government regulation and oversight, including securities
                regulations and reporting requirements. As a public company, JFC is required to
                disclose more information to the public than other business structures, reducing
                privacy for the owners. However, this transparency can also build trust with
                stakeholders, such as investors and customers.</p>
            <p>Overall, JFC's status as a corporation has allowed it to grow and expand its
                operations, providing jobs and contributing to the Philippine economy. It has also
                allowed the company to access large amounts of capital, enjoy tax benefits, and
                provide limited liability protection to its shareholders. However, the corporation
                is also subject to double taxation, government regulation, and reduced privacy for
                the owners.</p>
