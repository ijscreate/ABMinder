<body><h2>Cross Elasticity of Demand</h2>
<p>Cross elasticity of demand is a concept that measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded
    of one good to changes in the price of another related good. It helps assess the degree of
    substitution or complementarity between two products and provides insights into the relationship
    between their respective demand levels.</p>
<h3>Formula and Calculation</h3>
<p>The formula for cross elasticity of demand is:</p>
<p><code>Cross Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A) / (% Change in Price
    of Good B)</code></p>
<h3>Types of Cross Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<h4>Positive Cross Elasticity</h4>
<p>Positive cross elasticity indicates a substitute relationship between the two goods. A percentage
    increase in the price of one good leads to a percentage increase in the quantity demanded of the
    other good. The magnitude of the cross elasticity coefficient indicates the degree of
    substitution between the goods.</p>
<h4>Negative Cross Elasticity</h4>
<p>Negative cross elasticity suggests a complementary relationship between the two goods. A
    percentage increase in the price of one good leads to a percentage decrease in the quantity
    demanded of the other good.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p><strong>Substitutes:</strong> Coffee and tea are considered substitutes. If the price of coffee
    increases by 10%, and as a result, the quantity demanded of tea increases by 5%, the cross
    elasticity of demand is 0.5. This positive cross elasticity indicates that coffee and tea are
    substitutes, and when the price of one increases, consumers switch to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Complements:</strong> Hot dogs and hot dog buns are considered complements. If the price
    of hot dogs increases by 8%, and as a result, the quantity demanded of hot dog buns decreases by
    4%, the cross elasticity of demand is -0.5. This negative cross elasticity indicates that hot
    dogs and hot dog buns are complements, and when the price of one increases, consumers purchase
    less of the other.</p>
<h3>Significance in Market Analysis</h3>
<p>Understanding cross elasticity of demand is crucial for businesses and policymakers as it helps
    them identify substitute or complementary relationships between goods and make informed
    decisions regarding pricing, promotional strategies, and market positioning. It can also be
    useful for forecasting and market analysis by anticipating the potential impact of price changes
    for their goods on the demand for other related products.</p>
