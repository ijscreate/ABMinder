<h2>Understanding Debit Cards</h2>

<p>A debit card is a payment card that allows you to make secure and straightforward purchases
    online and in person by drawing money directly from your checking account. It is not a credit
    card, meaning you are not borrowing from a line of credit when you use it. Instead, the money on
    your debit card is your own.</p>

<p>Debit cards are typically issued by banks or credit unions when you open a checking account, and
    they can be used to make purchases at stores, withdraw or deposit cash at ATMs, and make
    payments through mobile payment platforms such as Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet, and Google Wallet.
    Debit cards can also be used with many money transfer apps such as Venmo and Cash App.</p>

<h3>Types of Debit Cards:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regular Debit Cards:</strong> Linked to your checking account and perform a
        real-time transaction every time you make a purchase or ATM withdrawal.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prepaid Debit Cards:</strong> Require you to load the card in advance via cash,
        checks, online transfers, or a visit to a retailer. Ideal for individuals without access to
        a bank account.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>However, it's important to note that prepaid debit cards don't help you build credit.</p>

<h3>Fees and Charges:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Out-of-Network ATM Fees:</strong> Charged when using an ATM that is not affiliated
        with your bank.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Foreign Transaction Fees:</strong> Applied for transactions made outside of your
        home country.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Debit Card Replacement Fees:</strong> Charged for replacing a lost or stolen debit
        card.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Overdraft or Nonsufficient Funds (NSF) Fees:</strong> Incurred when you spend more
        money than you have in your account.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Monthly Fees:</strong> Some banks may charge a monthly maintenance fee for using a
        debit card.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If your debit card is stolen, it's important to call your bank immediately and follow up in
    writing to report the loss or theft. You may be responsible for charges made on a lost or stolen
    debit card, depending on when you report the loss or theft to your bank.</p>

<h3>Advantages of Debit Cards Over Credit Cards:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Direct access to your funds without accumulating debt or interest charges.</li>
    <li>No interest charges associated with debit card purchases.</li>
    <li>Helps avoid overspending and manage expenses within your budget.</li>
    <li>Fraud protection and ATM access for cash withdrawals.</li>
    <li>No annual fees, credit inquiries, or credit score impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Debit cards and credit cards are both useful, but they have different benefits. Debit cards are
    more suitable for individuals who prefer to spend within their means and avoid debt
    accumulation.</p>
