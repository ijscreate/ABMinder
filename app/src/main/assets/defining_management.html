<h2>Defining Management</h2>
<p>Management is a process with a social element. It requires the efficient use of resources
    combined with the guidance of people in order to reach a specific organizational objective. It
    involves responsibility to achieve the objectives and to fulfill specific organizational
    purposes through economical and effective planning and regulation. It’s about taking charge and
    ensuring focus is placed on the things and aspects of the business that help achieve the vision
    and the goals.</p>

<p>Three key characteristics define the process of management:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, management is a process of continuing and related activities. Each of the functions
        is related to each other and the functions complement each other. It is hard to consider the
        functions in isolation, as management requires each activity to complement one another. When
        you as a manager engage in one function, you in effect also start the process of another
        function.
    </li>
    <li>The second core characteristic of management is about it involving and concentrating on
        organizational goals. Management is largely focused on achieving the key mission of the
        organization, its vision. Whilst there are detailed objectives it might focus on, management
        is mainly interested in identifying the wider organizational goals and using the different
        functions in order to achieve the objectives. Each function takes the organization closer to
        achieving its vision.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, management achieves the organizational goals by working with people and
        organization resources. You might use different financial resources or physical equipment as
        part of the process, while also directing and guiding the staff towards the objectives. The
        manager is in charge of supporting the people and connecting the right person with the right
        resources.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In essence, management is about a dynamic process, with a number of elements and activities as
    part of the process. The dynamic and social element of management mean the functions of
    management are separate from operational functions. Whilst operational functions refer to
    activities and processes such as marketing, finances and purchases, the management functions
    differ depending on the organizational level at which they take place.</p>

<p>The functions remain the same, yet are essentially different depending on the organizational
    hierarchy. A manager at the senior level will be involved in different activities than the
    manager at the junior level. The core concepts might be the same, but they are dynamic in
    manifestation. On the other hand, operational function of marketing will change according to the
    organization, the person in charge and the operational goals. For management functions, the
    objective of the specific activity remains largely the same, even though the manifestation might
    be different depending on the specific situation.</p>

<p>Management functions are the same, but the management processes people use can differ. A
    management style or process can depend on the organization, the manager in question, and even
    the objectives. You’re likely to change management style if you are directing a single person or
    being in control of a team. You can find out more about management styles from the introductory
