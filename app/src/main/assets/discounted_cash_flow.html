    <b>Key Concepts:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Introduction:</b> Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is a financial valuation method used to
    estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves
    discounting these future cash flows to their present value, considering the time value of money.
    <br><br>
    <b>Formula:</b> The general DCF formula is NPV = CF₁ / (1 + r)¹ + CF₂ / (1 + r)² + ... + CFₙ /
    (1 + r)ⁿ, where NPV is the Net Present Value, CF represents the expected cash flows for each
    period, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.
    <br><br>
    <b>Discount Rate:</b> Choosing an appropriate discount rate is crucial in DCF analysis. It
    reflects the opportunity cost of investing money elsewhere and the risk associated with the
    investment.
    <br><br>
    <b>Applications:</b> DCF analysis is widely used in business and finance for valuing
    investments, acquisitions, and projects. It helps in making informed decisions by assessing the
    attractiveness of an investment based on its expected returns.

<b>Steps in DCF Analysis:</b>
<br><br>
<b>1. Forecast Cash Flows:</b> Estimate the expected cash flows the investment will generate over a
specified period.
<br><br>
<b>2. Choose a Discount Rate:</b> Select an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk and
return expectations for the investment.
<br><br>
<b>3. Discount Future Cash Flows:</b> Apply the discount rate to each future cash flow to find its
present value.
<br><br>
<b>4. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV):</b> Sum up all the present values to determine the Net
Present Value.
<br><br>
<b>5. Evaluate Results:</b> Assess the NPV to determine if the investment is attractive. A positive
NPV suggests the investment may be worthwhile.

<b>Considerations in DCF Analysis:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Risk and Uncertainty:</b> DCF analysis involves making future projections, and uncertainties may
impact results. Consider sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changing variables.
<br><br>
<b>Terminal Value:</b> DCF often includes estimating the terminal value, representing the value of
an investment at the end of the forecast period.
<br><br>
<b>Market Conditions:</b> Changes in economic conditions and market trends can affect cash flow
projections and discount rates.
<hr>
<b>Example:</b>
<br><br>
<b>Calculating DCF:</b>
<br><br>
Assume an investment generates expected cash flows of $1,000 per year for the next 5 years with a
discount rate of 8%. The DCF calculation would be:
<br><br>
NPV = $1,000 / (1 + 0.08)¹ + $1,000 / (1 + 0.08)² + ... + $1,000 / (1 + 0.08)⁵
<br><br>
Evaluate the NPV to determine the attractiveness of the investment.
