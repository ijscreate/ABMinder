<h2>Economic Development</h2>
<div>
    <p>Economic development is the process of improving the economic well-being and quality of life
        for a community. It involves programs, policies, or activities that seek to enhance the
        economic well-being and quality of life for a community, with the aim of creating wealth and
        community benefits.</p>
    <p>Economic development can be achieved through various approaches, including business retention
        and expansion, attracting new businesses, and encouraging the growth of new businesses. The
        goal is to create sustained economic growth that provides sufficient incomes for the local
        labor force, profitable business opportunities for employers, and tax revenues for
        maintaining an infrastructure to support this continued growth.</p>
    <p>Economic development is not the same as community development, which is a process for making
        a community a better place to live and work. Instead, economic development is purely and
        simply the creation of wealth in which community benefits are created.</p>
    <p>Economic development is crucial for underdeveloped nations, as understanding the theory of
        economic development is essential for their evolution into sophisticated and relatively
        self-sufficient economies. Despite the widespread use of the term, there is no universally
        accepted definition of a developing country or what constitutes the process of economic
        development. Developing countries are typically categorized based on a per capita income
        criterion, with economic development being thought to occur as per capita incomes rise.</p>
    <p>There are several challenges associated with measuring both the level of per capita income
        and its rate of growth, including borderline cases, technical difficulties in converting
        national incomes into a common denominator, and estimating the value of noncash components
        of real incomes in underdeveloped countries. Despite these challenges, measures of per
        capita income correlate reasonably well with other measures of economic well-being, such as
        life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and literacy rates.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Economic development is crucial for job creation and improving the material standards of
        living for a community. Economic development involves qualitative and quantitative
        improvements in a country's economy, including job creation and raising per capita incomes.
        Creating more and better quality jobs is key to boosting growth, reducing poverty, and
        increasing social cohesion.</p>
    <p>Empirical studies have found that economic growth tends to be positively associated with job
        creation. For example, Khan (2007) finds that employment elasticity of GDP growth in
        developing countries is 0.7, meaning that a 1% increase in GDP growth leads to a 0.7%
        increase in employment. Kapsos (2005) finds that for every 1-percentage point of additional
        GDP growth, total employment has grown between 0.3 and 0.38 percentage points during the
        three periods between 1991 and 2003.</p>
    <p>However, it is important that growth occurs in sectors that have the potential to absorb
        labor at a large scale. Some sectors and activities are more employment-intensive than
        others. For example, a literature review by Basnett and Sen (2013) identifies an extensive
        body of evidence which suggests that growth in manufacturing and services have a
        particularly positive impact on employment. The impact of GDP growth on employment in
        agriculture is found to be limited overall, while value-added growth in the agriculture
        sector has a relatively large impact on employment. For textiles, the body of evidence was
        small, but the studies suggest that growth positively contributed to job creation. For
        agri-business/food processing, the authors find a positive impact of growth on employment.
        Melamed, Hartwig and Grant (2011) suggest that growth in services is becoming relatively
        more important in driving employment than manufacturing.</p>
