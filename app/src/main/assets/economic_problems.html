<h2>Basic Economic Problems</h2>
<div>
    <p>The basic economic problems of society revolve around the fundamental issue of scarcity and
        the challenge of efficiently allocating limited resources to satisfy unlimited human wants
        and needs. These economic problems are encapsulated in three key questions that every
        society must address:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>What to Produce:</strong> Societies must decide what goods and services to
            produce and in what quantities, considering the needs and desires of the population.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How to Produce:</strong> Once the decision on what to produce is made, societies
            need to determine the most efficient and effective methods of production, including the
            optimal use of resources like labor, capital, and technology.
        </li>
        <li><strong>For Whom to Produce:</strong> After determining what and how to produce,
            societies must allocate the produced goods and services to different individuals and
            groups, raising questions about resource distribution and equitable allocation among the
            population.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These economic problems stem from the reality of scarcity, where resources such as land,
        labor, capital, and natural resources are limited, while human wants and needs are virtually
        unlimited. To address these challenges, different economic systems have evolved:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Economies:</strong> Based on the principle of supply and demand, market
            economies allow prices to be determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers,
            facilitating efficient resource allocation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Planned (Command) Economies:</strong> Characterized by central planning, planned
            economies involve government decisions on production and resource allocation to meet
            basic needs, albeit with potential inefficiencies.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Economies:</strong> Combining elements of market and planned economies,
            mixed economies strike a balance between government intervention and free market
            activity to achieve both efficiency and equity.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In essence, the basic economic problems of society revolve around the fundamental challenge
        of scarcity and the need to make choices and trade-offs to allocate resources efficiently,
        optimize production, and meet the diverse needs and desires of individuals and
        societies.</p>
