    <h2>Economic Resources</h2>
    <p>Economic resources are the different factors of production used to produce all goods and
        services in an economy. They are classified into four general types:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Land or Natural Resources:</strong> Refers to all the natural resources used in
            the economy, such as land, water, animals, and minerals.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Labor:</strong> Refers to the people needed to grow or make and sell a product
            or service.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capital Resources:</strong> Include money to start a new business, tools,
            buildings, machinery, and any other goods people make to produce goods and provide
            services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Entrepreneurial Ability:</strong> The ability to organize, manage, and take
            risks in a business.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Economic resources are essential for the production of goods and services, and their
        allocation is a fundamental problem in both business and economics. The goal of economic
        systems is to satisfy the needs and wants of consumers, but with scarce resources, we must
        choose how to allocate them to achieve optimal outcomes. The production possibilities
        frontier is a tool for understanding the optimal outputs when producing different goods
        using the same resources.</p>
    <p>The scarcity of economic resources forces business owners and managers to constantly decide
        how to best use them. If a business does not use its economic resources most efficiently, it
        will likely not succeed in the long run. The success of any business, and the economy at
        large, requires using the four economic resources most optimally.</p>
    <p>Economics is concerned with allocating these resources so that the production of goods and
        services is done efficiently. The limited supply of resources for individuals or companies
        is an outcome of their affordability. Microeconomic theory focuses on how individuals,
        households, or businesses make decisions using the resources they have.</p>
    <p>Economic resources are the different factors of production used to produce all goods and
        services in the economy. Land refers to all the natural resources used in the economy. In
        the most basic sense, land is required to produce anything. A business might use land to
        grow corn, dig for oil, build a factory, or provide a space for a store. Labor refers to the
        people needed to grow or make and sell a product or service. Capital resources include money
        to start a new business, tools, buildings, machinery, and any other goods people make to
        produce goods and provide services. Entrepreneurial ability is the ability to organize,
        manage, and take risks in a business.</p>
