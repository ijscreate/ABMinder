    <h2>Price Elasticity of Demand</h2>
    <p>Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in the demand for a product in
        relation to a change in its price. It is mathematically expressed as the percentage change
        in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Price Elasticity of Demand</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the price elasticity is greater than 1, the good is considered
            <strong>elastic</strong>, meaning that changes in price yield a significant change in
            demand.
        </li>
        <li>If the price elasticity is less than 1, the good is considered
            <strong>inelastic</strong>, meaning that changes in price yield an insignificant change
            in demand.
        </li>
        <li>If the price elasticity is exactly 1, it is known as <strong>unitary elasticity</strong>,
            meaning that changes in price yield equivalent (percentage) changes in demand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Factors That Affect Price Elasticity of Demand</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Availability of Substitutes:</strong> The easier it is to substitute one product
            for another, the more elastic the demand will be.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> The more discretionary a purchase is, the more its demand will
            fall in response to price increases.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Duration of Price Change:</strong> Demand response to price fluctuations differs
            based on the duration of the price change.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <td>Less than 1</td>
            <td>Inelastic</td>
            <td>Changes in price yield an insignificant change in demand</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Perfectly inelastic</td>
            <td>Changes in price yield no change in demand</td>
        </tr>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Suppose that the price of apples falls by 6% from $1.99 a bushel to $1.87 a bushel. In
        response, grocery shoppers increase their apple purchases by 20%. The elasticity of apples
        is thus calculated as 0.20 รท 0.06 = 3.33. This indicates that the demand for apples is quite
        elastic.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Price Elasticity of Demand</h3>
    <p>Knowing the price elasticity of demand for goods allows sellers to make informed decisions
        about pricing strategies. It provides sellers with valuable information about consumer
        pricing sensitivity and helps in determining manufacturing plans and assessing tax
        impositions on goods.</p>
