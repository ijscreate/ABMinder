    <h2>Elements of the Accounting Equation</h2>

    <p>
        Assets: Assets are resources owned or controlled by a business that can be measured in
        monetary terms. Assets can be classified into two categories: current assets and non-current
        assets. Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up
        within one year or less. Examples of current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and
        inventory. Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or
        used up within one year. Examples of non-current assets include property, plant, and
        equipment.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of Assets:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Cash is the most liquid asset, meaning it can be easily converted
            into other assets or used to pay debts. Cash includes physical currency, coins, and
            funds held in checking or savings accounts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> Accounts receivable is the amount of money owed to
            a business by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered but not yet
            paid for.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Inventory is the goods or materials that a business has on
            hand for sale or for use in the production of goods or services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Property, Plant, and Equipment:</strong> Property, plant, and equipment are
            long-term assets used in the operation of a business. Examples include buildings,
            machinery, vehicles, and furniture.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Investments are assets that a business owns with the
            expectation of earning a return. Examples include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Intangible assets are non-physical assets that
            provide value to a business, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepaid Expenses:</strong> Prepaid expenses are assets that have been paid for
            in advance, such as prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, or prepaid taxes.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <th>5,200,000</th>

    </table>

    <h2>Liabilities:</h2>
    <p>
        Liabilities are the debts or obligations of a business that result from past transactions or
        events. Liabilities can be classified into two categories: current liabilities and
        non-current liabilities. Current liabilities are debts that are due within one year or less.
        Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, salaries payable, and taxes
        payable. Non-current liabilities are debts that are due after one year. Examples of
        non-current liabilities include long-term loans and deferred tax liabilities.
    </p>
    <h3>Examples of Liabilities:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Accounts Payable:</strong> When a local supermarket or convenience store like
            7-Eleven buys its goods, it is unusual for it to immediately pay cash for such goods.
            Normally, it would only incur an obligation to pay its supplier after a certain number
            of days. For example, when it gets a delivery of milk, it might have an agreement to pay
            its supplier only after 30 days. Thus, in the meantime that the product has not been
            paid yet, it would only carry a "payable" in its books.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unearned Revenue:</strong> Telecommunication companies such as Globe and Smart
            normally offer prepaid loads to customers. These load credits Can be later on used by
            customers for text messages or to call other people. On the other hand, when Globe or
            Smart receives payments from customers, it creates an obligation for them to deliver
            their services. Such obligations to give their service are recorded as liabilities.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Equity:</h2>
    <p>
        Equity is the residual interest in the assets of a business after all liabilities have been
        paid. Equity represents the ownership of the business and can be increased by profits or
        decreased by losses. Equity can also be referred to as net assets, shareholders' equity, or
        owner's equity.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        The accounting equation is a fundamental concept in double-entry bookkeeping, which is a
        method of recording financial transactions using debits and credits. The accounting equation
        ensures that the total debits and credits are always equal, maintaining the balance in the
        accounts. It helps assess whether the business transactions carried out by the company are
        being accurately reflected in its books.
