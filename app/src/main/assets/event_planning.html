<main>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Event planning refers to the process of organizing and coordinating all aspects of an
            event, from conception to execution. It involves managing various elements such as the
            event's purpose and objectives, budget, date and time, venue, program, marketing,
            suppliers, staff, volunteers, and contingency plans. <br>
            <br>
            Event planning can be a complex and challenging process, requiring a wide range of
            skills, including project management, communication, budgeting, negotiation,
            problem-solving, and attention to detail. Event planners must be able to manage multiple
            tasks simultaneously, prioritize tasks, and make timely decisions. <br>
            <br>
            Event planning can be applied to a wide range of events, including conferences,
            meetings, trade shows, product launches, fundraisers, social gatherings, and personal
            events such as weddings and parties. Effective event planning can help ensure a
            successful and memorable event, providing a positive experience for attendees and
            achieving the event's objectives.

    <div class="step">
        <h3 class="step-title" style="text-align: center;">How to plan an event:</h3>
        <h3 class="step-title">1. Define Your Event's Purpose and Goals</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Every successful event starts with a clear purpose and set of goals.
            Begin by clarifying why you are hosting the event and what you hope to achieve. This
            could be anything from raising awareness about a particular issue to generating sales
            for your business. By defining your event's purpose and goals, you can ensure that all
            subsequent planning decisions align with your objectives and that you are able to
            measure the success of your event.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">2. Set a Budget</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Before you can begin planning your event in earnest, you need to
            determine your budget. This will help you ensure that your event remains financially
            feasible and that you are able to allocate resources effectively. Consider all expenses,
            including venue rental, catering, entertainment, marketing, and staff costs. Be sure to
            also allocate a contingency fund for unexpected expenses. Once you have determined your
            budget, you can begin making more detailed plans for your event.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">3. Choose a Date and Time</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Selecting the right date and time for your event is critical to its
            success. Consider factors such as holidays, competing events, and seasonal
            considerations. You should also think about your target audience and what times they are
            most likely to be available. Once you have chosen a date and time, be sure to
            communicate this clearly to attendees and stakeholders.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">4. Select a Venue</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Choosing the right venue is essential to the success of your event.
            Consider factors such as location, capacity, amenities, and cost. You should also think
            about your event's requirements, such as whether you need a stage, audiovisual
            equipment, or specialized lighting. Once you have identified a few potential venues, be
            sure to visit them in person to assess their suitability. Once you have chosen a venue,
            be sure to confirm all details in writing and to negotiate a contract that meets your
            needs.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">5. Develop a Marketing Plan</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Promoting your event effectively is essential to its success. Begin
            by identifying your target audience and the channels through which they are most likely
            to be reached. You should also consider your event's branding and messaging, and ensure
            that these are consistent across all marketing materials. Create a timeline for
            marketing activities and track your progress. Be sure to also allocate resources for
            paid advertising, such as social media ads or Google AdWords.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">6. Secure Suppliers and Vendors</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Booking suppliers and vendors for services such as catering,
            audiovisual equipment, decorations, and transportation is an essential part of planning
            your event. Be sure to negotiate contracts and confirm arrangements well in advance. You
            should also consider factors such as dietary restrictions and accessibility requirements
            when selecting suppliers and vendors. Once you have confirmed arrangements, be sure to
            communicate all details to attendees and stakeholders.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">7. Create an Event Schedule</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Developing a detailed schedule for your event is essential to
            ensuring that it runs smoothly. This should include timelines for setup, registration,
            presentations, activities, and cleanup. Be sure to also allocate time for breaks and
            networking opportunities. Share the schedule with staff, volunteers, and attendees well
            in advance, and be sure to communicate any changes or updates as they arise.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">8. Coordinate Staff and Volunteers</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Recruiting and training staff and volunteers to assist with various
            aspects of your event, such as registration, hospitality, technical support, and
            security, is essential to its success. Be sure to assign roles and responsibilities
            clearly and to provide clear instructions and training. You should also consider factors
            such as dress code, communication protocols, and emergency procedures.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">9. Prepare for Contingencies</h3>
        <p class="step-content">Identifying potential risks and developing contingency plans to
            address them is an essential part of planning any event. Consider factors such as
            inclement weather, technical failures, medical emergencies, and attendee disruptions. Be
            sure to communicate all contingency plans to staff, volunteers, and attendees, and to
            have backup plans in place in case of unexpected issues.</p></div>
    <div class="step"><h3 class="step-title">10. Evaluate Your Event's Success</h3>
        <p class="step-content">After your event concludes, it's essential to evaluate its success
            based on your original goals and objectives. Gather feedback from attendees, staff, and
            stakeholders to identify areas of improvement for future events. You should also
            consider factors such as attendance, engagement, and revenue generated. Use this
            information to refine your event planning process and to ensure that future events are
            even more successful.</p></div>
