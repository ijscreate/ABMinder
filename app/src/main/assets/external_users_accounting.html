        <h3>Customers</h3>
        <p>Customers are interested in a company's accounting information to determine if it will be
            profitable for them to transact with the business. For example, a customer might review
            a company's financial statements to assess the company's profitability, product quality,
            reliability, and future commitments before deciding to make a purchase.</p>
        <h3>Creditors</h3>
        <p>Creditors use a company's financial statements to assess the risk associated with lending
            to the company. They consider factors such as the profitability of the company, the
            amount of borrowings, and the riskiness of lending. For instance, a creditor may analyze
            a company's financial ratios to determine its ability to repay loans and the likelihood
            of default.</p>
        <h3>Investors</h3>
        <p>Investors use a company's financial statements to decide if they will invest in the
            business. They seek companies that can provide a decent return on their investment and
            evaluate the company's financial ratios to get a feel for how the company operates.
            Investors also look out for the earnings retention policy of a company, as this
            information is a key indicator if an investment will be profitable.</p>
        <h3>Government</h3>
        <p>The government uses a company's financial statements for regulatory purposes, such as
            ensuring compliance with tax laws and guidelines. They also use financial statements to
            compute the amount of taxes payable by a company and to scrutinize businesses,
            especially large ones, to prevent financial collapse.</p>
        <h3>Academe</h3>
        <p>Members of the academe, such as professors, researchers, and students, benefit from
            accounting information in a company's financial statements for academic purposes. They
            may use financial statements to study particular trends in a specific industry or the
            economy as a whole, identify loopholes and possible improvements in the accounting
            standards, and improve the accountancy practice in the country.</p>
        <h3>General Public</h3>
        <p>The general public is also considered an external user of accounting information. They
            may analyze financial statements to get an idea of how the industry operates and respond
            to various economic cycles. For example, the public may use financial statements to make
            decisions about their levels of consumption and spending, whether or not to start a
            business given the current economic conditions, to stay on their current job or look for
            a higher-paying job, and the best use of their resources.</p>
