<h2>The Famous Theories on the Functions of Management</h2>
<p>Since management involves solving the problems within an organization in order to reach the
    desired objectives, the focus is on understanding the functions that make up the process. As
    experts began studying and theorizing the essence of management, different ideas and concepts
    regarding the functions were born.</p>
<p>Although the theories about the functions of management lead to rather similar results, it can be
    helpful to study the differences as well as the historical journey to our current understanding
    of the functions. Here are a few of the most influential theories and theorists, who’ve outlined
    their ideas about the functions of management:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Henri Fayol:</strong> Henri Fayol was the first to attempt classifying managerial
        activities into specific functions. The French engineer established the first principles of
        the classical management theory at the start of the last century. Fayol is considered the
        founding father of concepts such the line and staff organization. Fayol defined the five
        core functions of management as forecasting, planning, organizing, commanding, and
        controlling.
    </li>
    <li><strong>George R. Terry:</strong> In 1968, George R. Terry outlined his view on the
        principles of management, identifying four core functions: Planning, Organizing, Actuating,
        and Controlling.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Harold Koontz and Cyril O’Donnell:</strong> In 1976, Harold Koontz and Cyril
        O’Donnell published an essay where they detailed five key functions of management: Planning,
        Organizing, Staffing, Directing/Leading, and Controlling.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the quick outlook highlights the alignment of the functions of management in different
    management theories.</p>
