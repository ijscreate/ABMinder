<h2>FILIPINO VALUE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>Cultural values are widely held beliefs about what is proper, good, and essential in a certain society.</p>
<p>The Filipino value system, often known as Filipino values, refers to a collection of ideals or a value system that a majority of Filipinos have historically considered significant in their lives. This Philippine value system consists of its own set of philosophies, moral standards, ethical practices, etiquette, and cultural and personal values, all of which are fostered by their society. However, as in every civilization, an individual's sacred values might vary depending on religion, upbringing, and other circumstances. Filipino Values refers to a set of values or a value system that the majority of Filipinos have historically valued in their lives.</p>

<h3>FILIAL PIETY</h3>
<p>The family is the most fundamental unit for Filipinos. Weekly family meals, massive Christmas celebrations, and attending Mass as a family are just a few examples of how close Filipino families are. Filipinos do not leave their homes until they marry, and even then, they make sure that their parents are welcomed into their new homes.</p>
<p>Because he is the breadwinner, the father is frequently regarded as the family's leader, whereas the mother is in charge of the family's household, education, and finances. However, as more mothers work outside the home, fathers and mothers have begun to share family responsibilities both inside and outside the home in recent years.</p>
<p>Filial piety is an important characteristic that requires reverence and respect for one's parents and elders. Parents have complete control over their children in a Filipino home, and their children grow up to revere their parents.</p>

<h3>PAG-GALANG (RESPECT)</h3>
<p>Filipino culture places a high value on respect. Our elders, parents, grandparents, older siblings, relatives, friends, and teachers are all treated with respect. Here are some examples of respect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using "po" at the end of phrases to address elders</li>
    <li>Answering, "opo" to properly respond "yes"</li>
    <li>Addressing your older sister or brother as "Ate" or "Kuya."</li>
    <li>Respectfully listening to your parents and teachers</li>
    <li>Using "mano po" to ask your elder relatives for blessings</li>
</ul>

<h3>PAGPAPAHALAGA SA PAMILYA (FAMILY ORIENTATION)</h3>
<p>Filipinos are known for their strong and intimate bonds to their families. They hold their family in high regard and prioritize them above all else. They work all day and do everything in their power to feed and care for their family.</p>
<p>This means that a person values his or her family highly and prioritizes them above anything else. For example, it's not uncommon for a father or mother in a Filipino household to look for work abroad or in a job they don't desire to provide a decent living for their family. They've made satisfying the family's fundamental requirements and practicing pagpapahalaga sa pamilya their top priorities.</p>

<h3>HIYA (SHAME)</h3>
<p>Hiya is a word that implies "shame." A Filipino's social behaviors and interactions are governed by this. It is this principle that motivates a Filipino to obey their parents, older siblings, and other authorities. This is also an important factor in one's family's loyalty. Filipinos think that failing to follow recognized social norms will disgrace themselves and their families.</p>
<p>For example, you're the current owner of Choco Loco, a neighborhood bakery, and you're considering turning it into a caf√©. Your parents, on the other hand, who began the business, advise you that it is not ideal because it was not their initial purpose. This is a problem. Should you pay attention to them out of courtesy, or should you stick to your well-thought-out business strategy? It's tough to move on with your plan because of your filial piety.</p>

<h3>AMOR PROPIO (SELF RESPECT)</h3>
<p>Another aspect that determines social etiquette in the Philippines is Amor Propio, or self-love. When followed, it is a sense of self-worth or self-respect that prevents hiya. Filipinos are aware of their own and their peers' amor. Although it comes from the Spanish, amor propio is actually a concept that predates the Spanish occupation. On the surface, it appears to be a feeling of self-worth and/or respect. It is loosely related to the cultivation and maintenance of ego in Western concepts.</p>

<h3>PAKIKISAMA (BEING WITH OTHERS)</h3>
<p>Pakikisama is a folk concept of awesome human relations that entails giving in or surrendering to the majority's wishes, even if they conflict with one's own. It means following in the footsteps of others, even if one does not agree with their notion or strategy. it's not always a terrible thing. Peer groups can sometimes inspire us to do positive things.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: the majority of our friends want to attend a career seminar, but a handful of us prefer to play video games. We don't want to be the skeptics, so we accompany the larger group to the session. In this circumstance, Pakikisama was beneficial to us. If we surround ourselves with excellent and moral friends, Pakikisama can be useful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, pakikisama has caused many families to fall apart. I knew a man who was always intoxicated when he returned home and was abusive to his wife and children. This father sacrificed his family's land and animals to buy whiskey for his barkada so that they would respect him. Pakikisama was destructive in this example.</p>
<p>As a company leader, you demonstrate pakikisama by mentoring newly hired employees and teaching them the tasks and responsibilities they must complete to succeed well. When you cover up for a coworker or help coworkers hide their faults that cost the organization money, you are not promoting pakikisama.</p>

<h3>SUKI</h3>
<p>What exactly is the Suki system? It's essentially a buddy method of conducting business in the Philippines, where a customer buys specific things from a specific seller, who then rewards them with discounts and other goodies in exchange for their exclusivity. Because trust is such an important component of this, it establishes a personal relationship between the people involved.</p>
<p>Choco Loco uses flour on a regular basis. You prefer to create a suki-relationship in order to get better pricing and purchase on credit. How do you go about making one? How can you keep a positive connection with your supplier? While having a suki is beneficial, it is generally preferable to have numerous suppliers you can rely on to deliver the things you require. Insect infestations or flooding at their facility could jeopardize your bread flour supply.</p>
