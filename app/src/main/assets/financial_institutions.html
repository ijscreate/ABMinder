    <h1>What Is a Financial Institution (FI)?</h1>
    <p>A financial institution (FI) is a company engaged in the business of dealing with financial
        and monetary transactions such as deposits, loans, investments, and currency exchange.
        Financial institutions include a broad range of business operations within the financial
        services sector, including banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment
        dealers.</p>

    </ul>

    <h1>Understanding Financial Institutions (FIs)</h1>
    <p>Financial institutions often match savers' or investors' funds with those seeking funds, such
        as borrowers or businesses seeking to trade shares of ownership for funds. Typically, this
        leads to future payments from the borrower or business to the saver or investor. The tools
        for matching all of these parties up include products such as loans, and markets, such as a
        stock exchange.</p>
    <p>At the most basic level, financial institutions allow people to access the money they need.
        For example, although banks do many things, their primary role is to take in funds—called
        deposits—from those with money, pool the deposits, and lend the money to others who need
        funds. Banks are intermediaries between depositors (who lend money to the bank) and
        borrowers (who the bank lends money to).</p>
    <p>This works well because while some depositors need their money at any given moment, most do
        not. So banks can use deposits to make long-term loans. This applies to almost every entity
        and individual in a capitalist system: individuals and households, financial and
        nonfinancial firms, and national and local governments.</p>
    <p>Financial institutions serve most people in some way as a critical part of any
        economy—whether in banking, insurance, or securities markets. Individuals and companies rely
        on financial institutions for transactions and investing. For example, the health of a
        nation's banking system is a linchpin of economic stability. Loss of confidence in a
        financial institution can easily lead to a bank run.</p>

    <h1>The Function of Financial Institutions in Capital Markets</h1>
    <p>Capital markets are important for functioning capitalist economies because they channel
        savings and investments between suppliers and those in need. Suppliers are people or
        institutions with capital to lend or invest. Suppliers typically include banks and
        investors. Those seeking capital are businesses, governments, and individuals.</p>
    <p>Financial institutions play an important role in capital markets, directing capital to where
        it is most useful. For example, a bank takes in deposits from customers and lends the money
        to borrowers, ensuring capital markets' efficient function.</p>

    <h1>Types of Financial Institutions</h1>
    <p>Financial institutions offer various products and services for individual and commercial
        clients. The specific services offered vary widely between different types of financial
        institutions. Here are some of the types consumers are most likely to use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Banks, Credit Unions, and Savings & Loans:</strong> These financial institutions
            accept deposits and offer checking and savings account services; make business,
            personal, and mortgage loans; and provide basic financial products like certificates of
            deposit (CDs). They may also act as payment agents via credit cards, wire transfers, and
            currency exchange.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Why Are Financial Institutions Important?</h1>
    <p>Financial institutions are essential because they provide a marketplace for money and assets
        so that capital can be efficiently allocated to where it is most useful. For example, a bank
        takes in customer deposits and lends the money to borrowers. Without the bank as an
        intermediary, any individual is unlikely to find a qualified borrower or know how to service
        the loan. Via the bank, the depositor can earn interest as a result. Likewise, investment
        banks find investors to market a company's shares or bonds to.</p>

    <h1>What Are the Different Types of Financial Institutions?</h1>
    <p>The most common types of financial institutions include banks, credit unions, insurance
        companies, and investment companies. These entities offer various products and services for
        individual and commercial clients, such as deposits, loans, investments, and currency
        exchange.</p>
