    <h3>What is Financial Leverage?</h3>
    <p>Financial leverage is the use of borrowed money (debt) to finance the purchase of assets with
        the expectation that the income or capital gain from the new asset will exceed the cost of
        borrowing.</p>
    <p>In most cases, the provider of the debt will put a limit on how much risk it is ready to take
        and indicate a limit on the extent of the leverage it will allow. In the case of
        asset-backed lending, the financial provider uses the assets as collateral until the
        borrower repays the loan. In the case of a cash flow loan, the general creditworthiness of
        the company is used to back the loan.</p>
    <p>This guide will outline how financial leverage works, how it’s measured, and the risks
        associated with using it.</p>
    <h3>Let us illustrate how financial leverage works:</h3>
    <p>When purchasing assets, three options are available to the company for financing: using
        equity, debt, and leases. Apart from equity, the rest of the options incur fixed costs that
        are lower than the income that the company expects to earn from the asset. In this case, we
        assume that the company uses debt to finance asset acquisition.</p>
    <h4>EXAMPLE 1</h4>
    <p>Imagine you want to purchase a property worth 1,000,000 pesos. You have two options:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using your own funds entirely.</li>
        <li>Using a combination of your own funds (equity) and borrowed funds (debt).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you use only your own funds, you invest ₱1,000,000. If the property value increases to
        ₱1,200,000, your return is ₱200,000 (20% return on investment).</p>
    <p>However, if you decide to use financial leverage and invest ₱500,000 of your own money and
        borrow the remaining ₱500,000, you can invest in two properties worth ₱1,000,000 each.</p>
    <p>If the property value increases to ₱1,200,000 each, your return will be ₱400,000 (40% return
        on your initial investment of ₱1,000,000), doubling your return compared to using your own
        funds entirely.</p>
    <h3>LET US DEFINE!</h3>
    <h4>Debt Ratio</h4>
    <p>The debt ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It is
        calculated by dividing total debt by total assets.</p>

            <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total
                Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}
            </annotation>
        </semantics>
    </math>
    <h4>Debt-to-Equity Ratio</h4>
    <p>The debt-to-equity ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.
        It indicates the proportion of equity and debt used by the company to finance its
        assets.</p>
    <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

                Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders' Equity}}
            </annotation>
        </semantics>
    </math>
    <h4>Interest Coverage Ratio</h4>
    <p>The interest coverage ratio measures a company's ability to meet its interest payments on
        outstanding debt. It shows how many times a company can cover its interest expenses with its
        earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).</p>
    <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
        <semantics>
            <mrow>
                <mtext>Interest&nbsp;Coverage&nbsp;Ratio</mtext>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mfrac>
                    <mtext>Earnings&nbsp;Before&nbsp;Interest&nbsp;and&nbsp;Taxes&nbsp;(EBIT)
                    </mtext>
                    <mtext>Interest&nbsp;Expenses</mtext>
                </mfrac>
            </mrow>
            <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} =
                \frac{\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\text{Interest Expenses}}
            </annotation>
        </semantics>
    </math>

    <p>A similar term for interest coverage ratio is “Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio.”</p>
    <p>Financial leverage can amplify returns, but it also increases risk. Understanding key ratios
        like the debt ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and interest coverage ratio is crucial for
        assessing a company's financial health and its ability to manage debt effectively.</p>


    <h3>Risks of Financial Leverage</h3>
    <div class="risk">
        <h4>Financial leverage, while potentially increasing a company's earnings, may also result
            in disproportionate losses.</h4>
        <p>These losses can occur when the interest expenses on the asset exceed the borrower's
            returns, such as when the asset's value declines or interest rates rise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk">
        <h4>Stock Price Volatility</h4>
        <p>Excessive financial leverage can lead to significant fluctuations in company profits,
            resulting in frequent rises and falls in stock prices.</p>
        <p>This volatility can make it difficult to accurately account for stock options owned by
            the company's employees and lead to higher interest payments to shareholders as stock
            prices increase.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk">
        <h4>Bankruptcy</h4>
        <p>In industries with low barriers to entry, revenue and profit fluctuations are more
            likely, making it easier for companies to fall into bankruptcy as they struggle to meet
            rising debt obligations and operating expenses.</p>
        <p>When a company is unable to pay its debts, creditors may file for bankruptcy in order to
            auction off the company's assets and recoup their losses.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk">
        <h4>Reduced Access to Additional Debt</h4>
        <p>Lenders assess a company's financial leverage when considering new loans.</p>
        <p>Companies with high debt-to-equity ratios may have difficulty securing additional funds
            due to the increased risk of default.</p>
        <p>If a lender does agree to extend credit to a highly-leveraged company, it will likely do
            so at a higher interest rate to compensate for the added risk.</p>

        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Financial Leverage</h3>
        <p>Financial leverage refers to the use of debt to finance a company's assets, with the
            expectation that the returns from the assets will exceed the cost of borrowing. Here are
            some advantages and disadvantages of financial leverage:</p>

        <div class="advantages">
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased returns:</strong> Financial leverage can amplify a company's
                    returns, allowing it to earn higher profits with the same amount of assets.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tax benefits:</strong> Interest payments on debt are tax-deductible,
                    reducing a company's taxable income and lowering its overall tax burden.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Debt financing can provide a company with more
                    flexibility than equity financing, as it allows the company to maintain control
                    over its operations and decision-making.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="disadvantages">
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased risk:</strong> Financial leverage can also amplify a company's
                    losses, potentially leading to bankruptcy if the returns from the assets are not
                    sufficient to cover the interest expenses.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Higher fixed costs:</strong> Interest payments on debt are fixed costs,
                    meaning they must be paid regardless of the company's profitability. This can
                    put a strain on a company's cash flow, particularly in times of economic
                    downturn.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduced access to debt:</strong> Companies with high levels of financial
                    leverage may have difficulty securing additional debt financing, as lenders may
                    view them as too risky.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reduced financial flexibility:</strong> High levels of financial
                    leverage can limit a company's financial flexibility, making it more difficult
                    to respond to changes in the business environment.
                </li>
            </ul>
