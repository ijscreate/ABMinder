<h2>About the FSRSC</h2>

<p>The Financial and Sustainability Reporting Standards Council (FSRSC) was established by the
    Professional Regulatory Commission (PRC) under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
    Philippine Accountancy Act of 2004 to assist the Board of Accountancy (BOA) in carrying out its
    power and function to promulgate accounting standards in the Philippines. The FSRSC’s main
    function is to establish generally accepted accounting principles in the Philippines.</p>

<p>The FSRSC is the successor of the Accounting Standards Council (ASC). The ASC was created in
    November 1981 by the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants (PICPA) to establish
    generally accepted accounting principles in the Philippines. The FSRSC carries on the decision
    made by the ASC to converge Philippine accounting standards with international accounting
    standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The FSRSC has full
    discretion in developing and pursuing the technical agenda for setting accounting standards in
    the Philippines. Financial support is received principally from the PICPA Foundation.</p>

<p>The FSRSC monitors the technical activities of the IASB and invites comments on exposure drafts
    of proposed IFRSs as these are issued by the IASB. When finalized, these are adopted as
    Philippine Financial Reporting Standards (PFRSs). The FSRSC similarly monitors issuances of the
    International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB, which it adopts
    as Philippine Interpretations. PFRSs and Philippine Interpretations approved for adoption are
    submitted to the BOA and PRC for approval.</p>

<h3>Our Relationship with the PIC</h3>

<p>The FSRSC formed the Philippine Interpretations Committee (PIC) in August 2006 to assist the
    FSRSC in establishing and improving financial reporting standards in the Philippines. The role
    of the PIC is principally to issue implementation guidance on PFRSs. The PIC Members are
    appointed by the FSRSC and include accountants in public practice, the academe and regulatory
    bodies and users of financial statements. The PIC replaced the Interpretations Committee created
    by the ASC in 2000.</p>

<h3>Philippine Sustainability Reporting Committee (PSRC)</h3>

<p>The Financial and Sustainability Reporting Standards Council (FSRSC) established the Philippine
    Sustainability Reporting Committee (PSRC) on October 21, 2022, to evaluate the International
    Sustainability Standards Board’s IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for local use and to
    issue local interpretation and guidance.</p>

<h4>Objectives</h4>

<p>The main objectives of the PSRC are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To issue implementation guidance on Philippine sustainability disclosure standards adopted
        by the Financial and Sustainability Reporting Standards Council (FSRSC) from the
        sustainability disclosure pronouncements duly issued by the International Sustainability
        Standards Board (ISSB);
    </li>
    <li>To comment on exposure drafts of proposed sustainability disclosure standards issued by the
        ISSB and other documents that may be issued for comment by the FSRSC; and
    </li>
    <li>To comment on exposure drafts of sustainability disclosure standards or proposed regulations
        with sustainability reporting relevance that may be issued by financial sector regulators
        and other relevant government agencies or stakeholders, such as the Securities and Exchange
        Commission, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Insurance Commission, Commission on Audit, and the
        Philippine Stock Exchange.
    </li>
</ul>
