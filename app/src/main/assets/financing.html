<h2>Financing - Investopedia</h2>
<div class="definition">
    <p>Financing is the process of providing funds for business activities, making purchases, or
        investing. Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, trust companies, and others
        provide financing for these activities.</p>
    <p>There are various types of financing available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debt Financing:</strong> Debt financing involves borrowing funds that must be
            repaid over time, typically with interest. Common forms of debt financing include loans,
            bonds, and lines of credit. This type of financing is often used for short-term working
            capital needs or long-term investments in equipment, real estate, or other assets. Debt
            financing is popular because it allows businesses to retain ownership and control while
            obtaining the necessary funds.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equity Financing:</strong> Equity financing involves raising capital by selling
            shares of ownership in a company to investors. In exchange for their investment,
            investors receive ownership stakes in the company, which can provide them with a share
            of the company's profits. Equity financing is often used to fund high-growth startups or
            companies in need of significant capital investments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Asset-Based Financing:</strong> Asset-based financing involves using company
            assets as collateral to secure financing. Common forms of asset-based financing include
            asset-based loans and factoring. Asset-based financing is often used to unlock the value
            of existing assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, or equipment, to generate
            additional working capital.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Project Financing:</strong> Project financing involves securing financing for
            specific projects, often through a separate legal entity created for the project. This
            type of financing is often used for large-scale projects, such as construction,
            infrastructure, or energy projects. Project financing allows companies to fund projects
            without putting their entire balance sheet at risk.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Trade Financing:</strong> Trade financing involves financing the import, export,
            or domestic sale of goods. Services such as letters of credit, export credit, and trade
            finance facilities help businesses manage the financial risks associated with
            international trade and provide the necessary capital to facilitate transactions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Financing plays a crucial role in business operations and economic growth by providing the
        capital needed for investment, expansion, and innovation.</p>
