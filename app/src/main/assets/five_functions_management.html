<h2>The Five Functions of Management</h2>
<p>While there are slight variations in how the functions are named and the different management
    theories might combine or divide certain functions into smaller chunks, the consensus points to
    five core functions. What do these functions entail, why are they important and how to utilize
    them?</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The first managerial function involves planning. The function is about creating a detailed plan
    towards achieving a specific organizational objective. When you are planning, you are
    identifying the tasks, which are required to achieve the desired goals, outlining how the tasks
    should be performed, and identifying when and by whom they must be performed. The focus of
    planning is about achieving the objectives and it does require knowledge of the organization’s
    objectives and vision. You will need to look both at the short- and long-term success of the
    organization as part of the plan.</p>
<p>An example of planning would be a situation where you have an objective, such as increasing the
    sales by 20% in the following month. You will need to look at the different ways you and the
    team could achieve this goal. This might include things like creating a new advertisement
    campaign, reducing prices or speaking to customers about their shopping plans. Your role is to
    pick the processes that you find the most appropriate and to organize them into a logical
    pattern. You must also identify the timeline for these processes.</p>
<p>As you might realize, planning is an ongoing function. Management will regularly have to plan the
    future tasks and adjust the plans based on the organizational situation and the achievement of
    previous goals. Furthermore, it requires the whole organization to work together as the
    different departments or team plans need to link to each other and align with the organizational
    objective. Henri Fayol called the function the most difficult to achieve! You need a lot of
    knowledge and flexibility in order to plan activities effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Why is planning essential?</strong></p>
<p>Planning provides the organization a better sense of what it wants to achieve and how it can
    achieve this. You essentially have more focus when you plan for things. Think what would happen
    if you went into a big job interview without any planning.</p>
<p>You might be OK, but you wouldn’t be able to focus on the details and it might take time for you
    conduct your answers. But if you plan for the interview, you know exactly the points you want to
    make, you have enough knowledge to respond to specific questions about the company and so
    on.</p>
<p>In effect, planning ensures the proper utilization of the available resources and the ability to
    understand how these should be used in order to achieve the goal. In the example of the
    interview, the planning helps you take advantage of information on company websites, research
    interview questions and to then use this information to outline example answers.</p>
<p>A key part of planning is also the vital role it plays in reducing risks. When management plans
    for the tasks ahead, they are looking at the situation and detailing the possible pitfalls
    ahead. As with your interview, the risk of not knowing anything about the company or giving an
    incoherent answer is higher than if you had planned your answers a little.</p>
<p><strong>How to plan?</strong></p>
<p>Planning is an intellectual activity that doesn’t always require a lot of visible labor and
    effort, as much of it is about thinking creatively about the issues at hand. When you need to
    engage in planning, you should focus on the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gain knowledge of the issues – You need to understand the organizational objectives, the
        different components they involve, and the available resources you and the team have. You
        also need to be knowledgeable of the topic at hand. In terms of increasing sales, you need
        to have an understanding of how the sales industry works and what different methods can
        effectively boost company sales.
    </li>
    <li>Look into the future – The function is about understanding the short- and long-term
        objectives the organization wants to achieve. You need to consider not just these different
        elements, but also be able to make predictions about the future conditions for achieving
        these. Perhaps you have noticed changes in customer behavior due to the downturn in the
        economy. When you are planning, you need to take into account these little nuances.
    </li>
    <li>Determine the objectives – Once you are aware of the organizational objective, the resources
        available, and the future outlook to achieving the objectives, you need to identify the
        specific processes and detailed goals that are required to achieve the bigger goal. You
        might want to create a marketing campaign to increase sales, which requires the team to
        conduct market research and to come up with ideas. The more detailed objectives and
        processes you can set, the better the plan is.
    </li>
    <li>Create flexible structures – However, your planning needs to be flexible and take into
        account things don’t always go according to plan. Your management plan must take into
        account the other departments and their specific organizational goals. Perhaps the financial
        team has to cut down costs for the sales team and you need to be aware of the impact this
        would have on your new marketing campaign.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Organizing</h3>
<p>The next function of management follows planning and it is about organizing. It’s about using the
    plan to bring together the physical, financial and other available resources and use them to
    achieve the organizational goal. If your task were to increase sales, you would look at the plan
    and determine how to divide the resources you have in order to put your plan in place.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign would be handed out to Becky and you would provide them with the financial
    resources available and needed to give birth to the campaign. You would also need to ensure the
    team has access to the customer files in order to utilize vital information. You’d then direct
    Danny and his team to calculate the possible reductions you can make, help them have the
    resources to determine which products are best to discount and so on.</p>
<p>You’d use the above plan and information about the resources you have or which you need, and
    arrange the resources to the right tasks. As the example shows, this can be about arranging the
    finances, ensuring the right equipment is used and appointing the personnel to the specific
    tasks.</p>
<p>Your objective as the manager is to provide your team or department the resources it needs to
    execute the plan, but also to ensure the plan is implemented effectively. The function of
    organizing is therefore not just about dividing tasks, but also about coordination and
    monitoring the progress.</p>
<p><strong>Why is organizing essential?</strong></p>
<p>Organizing is essential because it ensures the organizational objectives can be achieved. Without
    organizing, your plan would be just a piece of paper with some pretty words. In order for the
    organization to be successful, it needs to be able to act on the plans and organizing helps the
    organization put its money where its mouth is.</p>
<p>Think of organizing as the phase where the organization gets ready for action. You are preparing
    the resources, getting the team members ready and ensuring everyone knows their role in
    achieving the objectives. In the example of the marketing campaign, you would organize the
    different components of the campaign and ensure everyone knows their part in executing the
    campaign. This might mean providing resources or tools to Becky’s team to come up with the
    creative ideas, ensuring Danny has the resources to calculate the potential profit from
    different price reductions and so on.</p>
<p>Organizing is also essential because it helps in the creation of structures. As you organize the
    different resources and people, you are essentially creating the structures which the
    organization can then rely on. In terms of the marketing campaign, you might notice the
    successful methods and processes in the campaign and decide to implement similar structures in
    the future. This can help the organization be more successful in executing future plans, as it
    knows which structures are most effective and what needs to be improved.</p>
<p><strong>How to organize?</strong></p>
<p>Organizing is about ensuring everything is ready for the execution of the plan. Therefore, you
    need to focus on the following steps when organizing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allocate resources – Your first task is to determine what resources are needed for executing
        the plan. This might be financial resources, but it could also be human resources or even
        technological resources. You need to determine what the plan requires and what the
        organization currently has available. You also need to consider if the resources aren’t
        currently available, how these could be obtained.
    </li>
    <li>Appoint tasks – You need to ensure every member of the team knows what they need to do in
        order to execute the plan. This means you need to assign different tasks to different team
        members and ensure they have the resources and knowledge to complete these. In the example
        of the marketing campaign, you might need to assign different tasks to Becky and Danny, and
        perhaps provide them with the needed resources for executing these tasks.
    </li>
    <li>Coordinate activities – Your role doesn’t end with just assigning tasks. You need to ensure
        the different tasks work together and that there is no overlap or gaps in the execution.
        This means you need to organize meetings and communication channels which allow the
        different team members to discuss their work and to align their activities with each other.
    </li>
    <li>Monitor progress – Finally, you need to monitor the progress of the different activities and
        ensure they are being completed according to plan. If there are issues, you need to
        intervene and provide solutions in order to ensure the plan can be executed effectively. You
        might notice the marketing campaign isn’t bringing in the expected results and you need to
        intervene to find out what’s going wrong and to make necessary adjustments.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The functions of management are vital for ensuring the success of an organization. By focusing on
    the planning and organizing functions, managers can ensure the organization knows what it wants
    to achieve and how it can achieve these objectives. Furthermore, by effectively planning and
    organizing, managers can ensure the organization has the resources and structures in place to
    execute the plans and to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s important for managers to understand the different functions of management and to
    utilize these in their day-to-day activities. By understanding the importance of planning and
    organizing, managers can help the organization achieve its objectives and to be successful in
    the long-term.</p>
