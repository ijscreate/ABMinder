<h1>Fixing</h1>

<h2>What Is Fixing?</h2>
<p>Fixing is the practice of setting the price of a product rather than allowing it to be determined
    by free-market forces. It becomes illegal when involving collusion among two or more producers
    or suppliers.</p>

<h2>Understanding Fixing</h2>
<p>In a free market, the price of a product or service is determined by the law of supply and
    demand. Fixing disrupts this natural equilibrium and is often a way to force consumers to pay
    more than they're willing to pay. It usually involves competitors secretly agreeing to keep
    their prices at a certain level to avoid price competition.</p>

<h2>Price-Fixing and Antitrust Laws</h2>
<p>Legal implications surrounding price-fixing are governed by antitrust laws like the Sherman Act,
    aiming to preserve fair competition and protect consumers. Engaging in price-fixing practices
    can lead to severe legal consequences for companies and individuals involved.</p>

<h2>Economic Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Price fixing disrupts the natural equilibrium between supply and demand in a competitive market.
    It artificially sets prices at a level different from what would emerge through free-market
    forces, leading to a mismatch between supply and demand.</p>

<h2>Price-Fixing and Small Businesses</h2>
<p>Price fixing can have detrimental effects on small businesses and entrepreneurs, making it
    challenging for them to maintain competitive pricing or attract customers. The anticompetitive
    practices may discourage innovation and new market entries.</p>

<h2>Horizontal vs. Vertical Fixing</h2>
<p>Horizontal price fixing occurs when competitors at the same level of the supply chain, such as
    rival companies or manufacturers, enter into agreements to set and maintain prices. Vertical
    price fixing involves agreements between entities at different levels of the supply chain,
    typically between manufacturers and retailers or distributors.</p>

<h2>Reasonable Cases of Price-Fixing</h2>
<p>In certain contexts, fixed prices may be reasonable, such as government oversight of essential
    services, internal collaboration of business groups, legal exemptions for professional
    associations, price floors, and customized pricing agreements. Each situation may vary and
    specific circumstances may or may not make each case illegal.</p>

<h2>Examples of Price-Fixing</h2>
<p>One classic example of price-fixing was carried out in the 1970s by the Organization of Arab
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). Another notorious case involved the Swiss pharmaceutical
    giant Roche in 1999, agreeing to pay a record U.S. fine related to the price of vitamins.
    Additionally, some countries may peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which is a legal form
    of exchange rate fixing.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Legal Exceptions to Price-Fixing Rules?</h2>
<p>While there are limited legal exceptions, such as government-regulated price controls in certain
    industries, most price-fixing agreements are illegal. Businesses should generally avoid engaging
    in any form of anticompetitive pricing.</p>

<h2>How Do Authorities Detect and Investigate Price-Fixing Schemes?</h2>
<p>Authorities employ various methods, including whistleblower reports, market monitoring, and data
    analysis, to detect and investigate price-fixing schemes. Entities can ask internal staff to
    provide information (without penalty) for information as well.</p>

<h2>Can Collaborations Within the Same Corporate Group Involve Price-Fixing?</h2>
<p>Collaborations within the same corporate group may involve internal agreements on pricing
    strategies, which are generally legal. However, these collaborations should not harm external
    competition.</p>

<h2>Are There Instances Where Governments Legally Fix Prices?</h2>
<p>Governments may legally fix prices in specific industries, such as utilities. These instances are
    carefully regulated and monitored to prevent abuse and protect consumer interests. In general,
    these are situations where the government may want to specifically control an industry and not
    encourage private companies to enter the market space.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Price fixing involves agreements among competitors to set and maintain specific prices for goods
    or services, restraining healthy market competition. This anticompetitive practice is illegal,
    violating antitrust laws, and can result in severe legal consequences.</p>
