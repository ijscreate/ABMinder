<h2>Demographic Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>Demographic forces relate to people. The name refers to the term Demography. The latter refers to
    the study of human populations. This includes size, density, age, gender, occupation and other
    statistics. Why are people important? Because, on the whole, their needs is the reason for
    businesses to exist. In other words, people are the driving force for the development of
    markets. The large and diverse demographics both offer opportunities but also challenges for
    businesses. Especially in times of rapid world population growth, and overall demographic
    changes, the study of people is crucial for marketers.</p>
<p>The reason is that changing demographics mean changing markets. Further, changing markets mean a
    need for adjusted marketing strategies. Therefore, marketers should keep a close eye on
    demographics. This may include all kinds of characteristics of the population, such as size,
    growth, density, age- and gender structure, and so on. Some of the most important demographic
    trends that affect markets are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>World population growth</li>
    <li>Changing age structure</li>
    <li>Changing family structures</li>
    <li>Geographic shifts in population</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economic Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>The Economic forces relate to factors that affect consumer purchasing power and spending
    patterns. For instance, a company should never start exporting to a country before having
    examined how much people will be able to spend. Important criteria are: GDP, GDP real growth
    rate, GNI, Import Duty rate and sales tax/ VAT, Unemployment, Inflation, Disposable personal
    income, and spending patterns.</p>

<h2>Socio-Cultural Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>The Socio-Cultural forces link to factors that affect society’s basic values, preferences and
    behavior. The basis for these factors is formed by the fact that people are part of a society
    and cultural group that shape their beliefs and values. Many cultural blunders occur due to the
    failure of businesses in understanding foreign cultures. For instance, symbols may carry a
    negative meaning in another culture. To understand these forces, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions
    can be used: Power Distance, Individualism versus Collectivism, Masculinity versus Femininity,
    Uncertainty Avoidance etc.</p>

<h2>Technological Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>Technological forces form a crucial influence in the Macro Environment. They relate to factors
    that create new technologies and thereby create new product and market opportunities.</p>
<p>A technological force everybody can think of nowadays is the development of wireless
    communication techniques, smartphones, tablets and so further. This may mean the emerge of
    opportunities for a business, but watch out: every new technology replaces an older one. Thus,
    marketers must watch the technological environment closely and adapt in order to keep up.
    Otherwise, the products will soon be outdated, and the company will miss new product and market
    opportunities.</p>

<h2>Ecological Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>Ecological, or natural forces in the Macro Environment are important since they are about the
    natural resources which are needed as inputs by marketers or which are affected by their
    marketing activities. Also, environmental concerns have grown strongly in recent years, which
    makes the ecological force a crucial factor to consider. For instance, world, air and water
    pollution are headlines every marketer should be aware of. In other words, you should keep track
    of the trends in the ecological environment.</p>
<p>Important trends in the ecological environment are the growing shortage of raw materials and the
    care for renewable resources. In addition, increased pollution, but also increased intervention
    of government in natural resource management is an issue.</p>
<p>Because of all these concerns and the increased involvement of society in ecological issues,
    companies more than ever before need to consider and implement environmental sustainability.
    This means that they should contribute to supporting the environment, for instance by using
    renewable energy sources. Thereby, businesses do not only support the maintenance of a green
    planet, but also respond to consumer demands for environmentally friendly and responsible
    products.</p>

<h2>Political Forces in the Macro Environment</h2>
<p>Every business is limited by the political environment. This involves laws, government agencies
    and pressure groups. This influence and restrict organizations and individuals in a society.
    Therefore, marketing decisions are strongly influenced and affected by developments in the
    political environment.</p>
<p>Before entering a new market in a foreign country, the company should know everything about the
    legal and political environment. How will the legislation affect the business? What rules does
    it need to obey? What laws may limit the company’s ability to be successful? For example, laws
    covering issues such as environmental protection, product safety regulations, competition,
    pricing etc. might require the firm to adapt certain aspects and strategies to the new
    market.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the company is surrounded by a complex environment. The Macro Environment
    consists of a large variety of different forces. All of these may shape opportunities for the
    company, but could also pose threats. Therefore, it is of critical importance that marketers
    understand and have an eye on development in the Macro Environment, to make their business grow
    in the long term.</p>
