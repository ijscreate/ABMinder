    <h2>Lesson 2.1: Formulating and Solving Problems involving Ratios</h2>
</header>

<section>
    <h3>Understanding Ratios in Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>Ratios play a crucial role in solving real-world problems by providing a means to compare
        quantities and
        establish relationships. When formulating and solving problems involving ratios, it's
        essential to grasp the
        context and interpret the ratio in the given scenario.</p>

    <p>Let's explore how to formulate and solve problems using ratios through examples and key
        concepts.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Identifying the Given Ratios</h3>
    <p>The first step is to identify the ratios provided in the problem. Whether it's a ratio of
        quantities,
        distances, or amounts, clearly define the relationship between the numbers involved.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Expressing Ratios in Different Forms</h3>
    <p>Understand the flexibility of expressing ratios. Whether presented as <code>a:b</code>,
        <code>a to b</code>, or
        <code>a/b</code>, these forms represent the same relationship. Choose the format that aligns
        with the
        problem's context.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Formulating the Problem</h3>
    <p>Translate the given information into a mathematical problem. Use the identified ratios to set
        up the problem
        statement. For example, if the problem involves a ratio of distances, consider the units of
        measurement to
        ensure consistency.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Solving the Problem</h3>
    <p>Apply the appropriate mathematical operations to find the solution. Depending on the problem,
        you may need to
        multiply, divide, or use other operations to determine the desired outcome. Always check the
        units and
        ensure the final answer makes sense in the given context.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Example: Applying Ratios to Solve a Real-World Problem</h3>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Suppose a recipe calls for a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of
            sugar. If you want to
            double the
            recipe, how much flour should you use?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Identify the given ratio: <code>2:3</code></p>
        <p>Since you want to double the recipe, multiply both parts of the ratio by 2:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            <p>Flour = <span class="numerator">2</span> x 2 = 4 cups</p>
            <p>Sugar = <span class="denominator">3</span> x 2 = 6 cups</p>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore, you should use 4 cups of flour to maintain the ratio when doubling the
            recipe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Imagine you are an architect working on a model of a building. The
            scaled model needs to
            represent the
            actual building accurately. The blueprint specifies a ratio of 1:100 for the model's
            dimensions to the
            real dimensions.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If the height of a specific section in the actual building is
            20 meters, how tall
            should the corresponding section be in the scaled model?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Identify the given ratio: <code>1:100</code></p>
        <p>Apply the ratio to find the height of the scaled model:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            <p>Height in Model = <span class="numerator">1</span> x 20 meters / <span
                    class="denominator">100</span> = 0.2
                meters</p>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore, the height of the corresponding section in the scaled model should be 0.2
            meters to maintain the
            1:100 ratio.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Consider a chef preparing a salad dressing with a specific oil to
            vinegar ratio. The
            original recipe
            specifies a ratio of 2:1 (2 parts oil to 1 part vinegar).</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If the chef wants to make 500 milliliters of dressing, how much
            oil and vinegar
            should be used?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Identify the given ratio: <code>2:1</code></p>
        <p>Calculate the amounts of oil and vinegar based on the ratio and desired quantity:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            <p>Oil = <span class="numerator">2</span> parts / (<span class="numerator">2</span> +
                <span
                        class="denominator">1</span>) * 500 ml = 333.33 ml</p>
            <p>Vinegar = <span class="denominator">1</span> part / (<span class="numerator">2</span>
                + <span
                        class="denominator">1</span>) * 500 ml = 166.67 ml</p>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore, to maintain the 2:1 ratio, the chef should use 333.33 ml of oil and 166.67 ml
            of vinegar to
            make 500 ml of dressing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Imagine an artist mixing paint colors to achieve a certain shade. The
            desired ratio is 3
            parts blue paint
            to 2 parts yellow paint.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If the artist needs 300 milliliters of the mixed color, how
            much blue and yellow
            paint should be used?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Identify the given ratio: <code>3:2</code></p>
        <p>Calculate the amounts of blue and yellow paint based on the ratio and desired
            quantity:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            <p>Blue Paint = <span class="numerator">3</span> parts / (<span
                    class="numerator">3</span> + <span
                    class="denominator">2</span>) * 300 ml = 180 ml</p>
            <p>Yellow Paint = <span class="denominator">2</span> parts / (<span
                    class="numerator">3</span> + <span
                    class="denominator">2</span>) * 300 ml = 120 ml</p>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore, to achieve the desired color, the artist should mix 180 ml of blue paint and
            120 ml of yellow
            paint.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Consider a classroom where the teacher wants to maintain a ratio of 4
            students with
            laptops to 3 students
            without laptops.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If there are 28 students in the class, how many should have
            laptops, and how
            many should not?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Identify the given ratio: <code>4:3</code></p>
        <p>Calculate the number of students with and without laptops based on the ratio and total
            number of
            students:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            <p>Students with Laptops = <span class="numerator">4</span> parts / (<span
                    class="numerator">4</span> +
                <span class="denominator">3</span>) * 28 = 16 students</p>
            <p>Students without Laptops = <span class="denominator">3</span> parts / (<span
                    class="numerator">4</span>
                + <span class="denominator">3</span>) * 28 = 12 students</p>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore, to maintain the desired ratio, the teacher should have 16 students with
            laptops and 12
            students without laptops in the classroom.</p>
    </div>
