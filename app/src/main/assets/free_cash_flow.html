    <h2>Free Cash Flow</h2>
    <p>Free cash flow (FCF) is a measure of a company's financial performance and is used to assess
        its ability to generate cash beyond what is required to maintain its current operations and
        investments. FCF represents the cash that a company has available to pay dividends, repay
        debt, make investments, and fund other activities that are not included in its day-to-day
        operations.</p>
    <h3>Formula:</h3>
    <p>FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures</p>
    <p>Operating cash flow is the cash a company generates from its core business operations, and it
        can be found on a company's cash flow statement. Capital expenditures, on the other hand,
        are the investments a company makes in long-term assets such as property, plant, and
        equipment.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>Let's say a company has an operating cash flow of ₱20 million and capital expenditures of ₱5
        million. To calculate the free cash flow, we would subtract the capital expenditures from
        the operating cash flow:</p>
    <p>FCF = ₱20 million - ₱5 million = ₱15 million</p>
    <p>This means that the company has ₱15 million in free cash flow, which it can use to pay
        dividends, repay debt, invest in new projects, and fund other activities.</p>
    <h3>Importance:</h3>
    <p>Free cash flow is a more accurate measure of a company's financial health, as it takes into
        account the cash generated by the company's operations and the investments it makes in
        long-term assets. Investors often use free cash flow to assess a company's potential for
        future growth, as it provides insights into its ability to invest in new products, enter new
        markets, and make strategic acquisitions.</p>
    <h3>Limitations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>FCF does not account for the quality of cash flow.</li>
        <li>Using FCF as a performance measure can cause systematic underinvestment.</li>
        <li>FCF yield may send short-term signals that run counter to maximizing the long-run value
            of a company.
        </li>
        <li>FCF does not consider the impact of non-operating items on a company's cash flow.</li>
    </ul>
