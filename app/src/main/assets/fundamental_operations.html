    <h3>Key Terms</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Fraction:</b> A number that represents a part of a whole. It is expressed as a ratio
            of two integers, where the numerator represents the part and the denominator represents
            the whole.
        </li>
        <li><b>Decimal:</b> A number that represents a part of a whole, using the base-10 number
            system. It is expressed as a series of digits to the right of a decimal point.
        </li>
        <li><b>Percentage:</b> A number that represents a part of a whole, expressed as a fraction
            of 100. It is denoted by the symbol %.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="visual-example">
        <h4>Example of a Fraction</h4>

        <p>Consider a pizza divided into 8 equal slices. If you take 3 of those slices, you have 3/8
            of the pizza. This is an example of a fraction, where 3 is the numerator and 8 is the
            denominator.</p>

        <div>
            <strong>Numerator:</strong> The number of slices you have (3).
        </div>

        <div>
            <strong>Denominator:</strong> The total number of equal slices in the pizza (8).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="visual-example">
        <h4>Example of a Decimal</h4>

        <p>The decimal equivalent of 3/8 is 0.375. This is because 3 divided by 8 equals 0.375.</p>

        <div>
            <strong>Decimal:</strong> A representation of the fraction 3/8 in the base-10 number
            system (0.375).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="visual-example">
        <h4>Example of a Percentage</h4>

        <p>If a product has a discount of 20%, this is equivalent to expressing the discount as a
            fraction of 1/5 or a decimal of 0.2. Understanding percentages allows businesses to make
            pricing decisions and communicate discounts effectively.</p>

        <div>
            <strong>Percentage:</strong> A representation of the discount as a fraction of 100
            (20%).
        </div>
