    <h1>GDP vs GNP: Functional Differences</h1>

    <div class="highlight"><h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the total
            value of all goods and services produced within the borders of a country during a
            specific period, typically a year or a quarter. It includes all goods and services
            produced by both domestic and foreign firms operating within the country's borders.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> GDP focuses on production that occurs within a country's
            geographical boundaries, regardless of the nationality of the producers. It measures the
            output of a country's economy, including its industries, services, and government
            sectors.</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> GDP comprises four main components: consumption (C),
            investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (NX). Consumption refers to the
            spending by households on goods and services, while investment includes business
            spending on capital goods, such as machinery and equipment. Government spending includes
            expenditures by federal, state, and local governments on goods and services. Net exports
            represent the difference between a country's exports and imports.</p>
        <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> GDP can be calculated using one of three methods: the
            production approach, the income approach, or the expenditure approach. The production
            approach measures GDP by adding up the total value of all goods and services produced in
            the economy. The income approach calculates GDP by adding up all the incomes earned by
            workers and businesses in the economy. The expenditure approach measures GDP by adding
            up all the spending on final goods and services in the economy.</p>
        <p><strong>Utility:</strong> GDP serves as a key indicator of a country's economic health
            and standard of living. It provides a snapshot of the overall economic activity in a
            country and can help policymakers make informed decisions about economic policy.
            However, GDP has its limitations as a measure of economic well-being, as it does not
            account for factors such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and the
            distribution of goods and services.</p>
        <div class="gdp-example">
            <h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Calculation Example</h2>
            <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the total value of all goods and
                services produced within a country's borders during a specific period, typically a
                year or a quarter. It is one of the most widely used indicators of a country's
                economic performance. Let's explore a detailed example to understand how GDP is
                calculated:</p>
            <div class="example-details">
                <h3>Example: Country Alpha</h3>
                <p>Let's consider the fictional country of "Alpha" for our example. In Country
                    Alpha, we have the following data for a given year:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Consumption (C):</strong> PHP 300 billion</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment (I):</strong> PHP 200 billion</li>
                    <li><strong>Government Spending (G):</strong> PHP 150 billion</li>
                    <li><strong>Exports (X):</strong> PHP 100 billion</li>
                    <li><strong>Imports (M):</strong> PHP 80 billion</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="calculation">
                <h3>Calculation:</h3>
                <p>GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)</p>
                <p>GDP = PHP 300 billion + PHP 200 billion + PHP 150 billion + (PHP 100 billion -
                    PHP 80 billion)</p>
                <p>GDP = PHP 750 billion</p>
            </div>
            <p>Therefore, Country Alpha's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the year is PHP 750
                billion. This figure represents the total value of all goods and services produced
                within the borders of Country Alpha during the specified period.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="highlight"><h2>Gross National Product (GNP)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Gross National Product (GNP) measures the total value of all
            goods and services produced by a country's residents, including those living abroad,
            during a specific period. It includes the income earned by citizens from domestic and
            foreign sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> GNP accounts for production by a country's citizens, regardless
            of where it occurs geographically. It includes the income earned by citizens from
            domestic and foreign sources, such as wages, profits, and interest. It is a broader
            measure than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) because it includes the output of citizens
            living abroad, such as expatriates and foreign workers.</p>
        <p><strong>Components:</strong> GNP includes consumption, investment, government spending,
            net exports, and net income from abroad. Consumption refers to the spending by
            households on goods and services, while investment includes business spending on capital
            goods, such as machinery and equipment. Government spending includes expenditures by
            federal, state, and local governments on goods and services. Net exports represent the
            difference between a country's exports and imports, while net income from abroad
            includes the income earned by citizens from foreign sources, such as dividends and
            interest, minus the income earned by foreigners from domestic sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> GNP can be calculated by adding the income earned by
            citizens from domestic and foreign sources and subtracting the income earned by
            foreigners from domestic sources. It can also be calculated by adjusting GDP for the
            income earned by citizens from foreign sources and the income earned by foreigners from
            domestic sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Utility:</strong> GNP provides a broader perspective on a country's economic
            activity by accounting for the contributions of its citizens worldwide. It is a useful
            measure for evaluating a country's economic performance and comparing it with other
            countries. However, it has its limitations as a measure of economic well-being, as it
            does not account for factors such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and
            the distribution of goods and services.</p>
        <div class="gnp-example">
            <h2>Gross National Product (GNP) Calculation Example</h2>
            <p>Gross National Product (GNP) is a measure of the total economic output produced by a
                country's residents, both domestically and abroad, within a specific time period.
                GNP includes the value of goods and services produced by a country's citizens
                regardless of their location. Let's delve into a detailed example to illustrate how
                GNP is calculated:</p>
            <div class="example-details">
                <h3>Example: Prosperia</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Domestic Production:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total value of goods and services produced within Prosperia's
                                borders by both domestic and foreign residents is PHP 500 billion.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Income from Abroad:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prosperians own businesses in other countries that generate PHP 50
                                billion in profits.
                            </li>
                            <li>Foreign investors in Prosperia earn PHP 30 billion in profits from
                                their investments.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Net Foreign Factor Income:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prosperia pays PHP 20 billion in income to foreign workers who work
                                within its borders.
                            </li>
                            <li>Foreign residents in Prosperia earn PHP 10 billion in wages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="calculation">
                <h3>Calculation:</h3>
                <p>GNP = Domestic Production + Income from Abroad - Net Foreign Factor Income</p>
                <p>GNP = PHP 500 billion + (PHP 50 billion + PHP 30 billion) - (PHP 20 billion + PHP
                    10 billion)</p>
                <p>GNP = PHP 500 billion + PHP 80 billion - PHP 30 billion</p>
                <p>GNP = PHP 550 billion</p>
            </div>
            <p>Therefore, Prosperia's Gross National Product (GNP) for the year is PHP 550 billion.
                This figure represents the total economic output generated by Prosperia's residents,

    <div class="income-approach">
        <h2>GDP/GNP Income Approach</h2>
        <p>The income approach is one of the methods used to calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
            or Gross National Product (GNP). It measures GDP/GNP by summing up the total incomes
            earned by individuals and businesses within a country or by its residents, respectively.
            Let's explore how the income approach is applied:</p>
        <h3>GDP Income Approach</h3>
        <p>For GDP, the income approach calculates the total income generated by factors of
            production within a country's borders. The key components of the GDP income approach
            include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wages and Salaries:</strong> This includes income earned by individuals
                through employment.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interest:</strong> Income earned from investments in bonds, savings
                accounts, etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rent:</strong> Income earned from leasing property or land.</li>
            <li><strong>Profits:</strong> Income earned by businesses after deducting expenses from
                revenue.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GDP is calculated by summing up the total income earned by these factors of
            production.</p>
        <h3>GNP Income Approach</h3>
        <p>For GNP, the income approach calculates the total income earned by a country's residents,
            both domestically and abroad. The key components of the GNP income approach include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domestic Income:</strong> Income earned by residents within the country's
                borders.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Foreign Income:</strong> Income earned by residents from investments or
                employment abroad, minus income earned by foreigners within the country.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GNP is calculated by summing up the domestic income and net foreign income.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="expenditure-approach">
        <h2>GDP/GNP Expenditure Approach</h2>
        <p>The expenditure approach is another method used to calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
            or Gross National Product (GNP). It measures GDP/GNP by summing up the total
            expenditures made on final goods and services within a country or by its residents,
            respectively. Let's delve into how the expenditure approach is applied:</p>
        <h3>GDP Expenditure Approach</h3>
        <p>For GDP, the expenditure approach calculates the total spending on goods and services
            within a country's borders. The key components of the GDP expenditure approach
            include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Consumption (C):</strong> Spending by households on goods and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment (I):</strong> Spending by businesses on capital goods and
                investments.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Government Spending (G):</strong> Spending by the government on goods and
                services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Exports (NX):</strong> The value of exports minus the value of imports.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GDP is calculated by summing up these components of expenditure.</p>
        <h3>GNP Expenditure Approach</h3>
        <p>For GNP, the expenditure approach calculates the total spending by a country's residents,
            both domestically and abroad. The key components of the GNP expenditure approach
            include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domestic Spending:</strong> Spending by residents within the country's
                borders.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Foreign Spending:</strong> Spending by residents on goods and services
                abroad, minus spending by foreigners within the country.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GNP is calculated by summing up domestic spending and net foreign spending.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="production-approach">
        <h2>GDP/GNP Production Approach</h2>
        <p>The production approach is a method used to calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or
            Gross National Product (GNP) by measuring the total value of goods and services produced
            within a country's borders or by its residents, respectively. Let's explore how the
            production approach is applied:</p>
        <h3>GDP Production Approach</h3>
        <p>For GDP, the production approach calculates the total value of goods and services
            produced within a country's borders. The key components of the GDP production approach
            include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Value Added by Industries:</strong> The value added at each stage of
                production by industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Gross Value of Output:</strong> The total value of goods and services
                produced before accounting for intermediate inputs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Intermediate Inputs:</strong> The value of goods and services used as inputs
                in the production process.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GDP is calculated by summing up the value added by industries across all sectors of
            the economy.</p>
        <h3>GNP Production Approach</h3>
        <p>For GNP, the production approach calculates the total value of goods and services
            produced by a country's residents, both domestically and abroad. The key components of
            the GNP production approach include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Domestic Production:</strong> The value of goods and services produced
                within the country's borders by its residents.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Net Foreign Factor Income:</strong> The difference between income earned by
                residents from abroad and income earned by foreigners within the country.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The GNP is calculated by summing up domestic production and net foreign factor
            income.</p>
