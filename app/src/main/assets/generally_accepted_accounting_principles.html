<h2>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) - Investopedia</h2>

<p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are a common set of accounting principles,
    standards, and procedures that companies use to compile their financial statements. GAAP are a
    combination of authoritative standards (set by policy boards) and the commonly accepted ways of
    recording and reporting accounting information.</p>

<h3>Understanding Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h3>

<p>GAAP provides a framework for companies to follow when preparing their financial statements. This
    framework helps to ensure that financial statements are accurate, reliable, and comparable
    across different companies. GAAP covers such things as revenue recognition, balance sheet
    classification, and financial statement disclosures.</p>

<p>GAAP is important because it provides a common language for companies to use when communicating
    financial information to investors, creditors, regulators, and other stakeholders. By following
    GAAP, companies can provide stakeholders with useful, relevant, and reliable information about
    their financial performance and position.</p>

<h3>Key Principles of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h3>

<p>The key principles of GAAP include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Financial information should be relevant to the decision-making
        needs of users.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Financial information should be reliable, meaning it is free
        from material error and bias.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Financial information should be consistent over time and
        comparable across different companies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Comparability:</strong> Financial information should be comparable across different
        reporting periods and companies.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>GAAP is a common set of accounting principles, standards, and procedures that
    companies use to compile their financial statements. GAAP provides a framework for companies to
    follow when preparing their financial statements, ensuring that financial information is
    accurate, reliable, and comparable across different companies.</p>
