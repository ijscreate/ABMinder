<body><h1>Gordon Growth Model: Understanding the Concept</h1>
<p> The Gordon Growth Model (GGM) is a financial model used to estimate the intrinsic value of a
    stock based on its expected future dividends and growth rate. The model is named after its
    creator, Myron Gordon, who first introduced it in 1962. The GGM is a popular tool among
    investors and financial analysts because it is simple, easy to use, and provides a quick
    estimate of a stock's intrinsic value. </p>

<p>The model is based on the concept of the present value of future cash flows. It assumes that the
    company pays a constant dividend that grows at a constant rate, and that the required rate of
    return on the stock is constant over time. The model also assumes that the stock is perpetual,
    meaning it has no maturity date, and that the growth rate of dividends is less than the required
    rate of return.</p>
<p>The GGM is particularly useful for estimating the intrinsic value of stocks that have a stable
    and predictable dividend stream, such as utility companies or consumer goods companies. It is
    less useful for estimating the intrinsic value of stocks that have a volatile dividend stream or
    no dividend at all, such as technology companies or startups.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, the Gordon Growth Model is a valuable tool for investors and financial
    analysts. It provides a framework for thinking about the relationship between a stock's dividend
    stream, growth rate, and required rate of return. By estimating the intrinsic value of a stock
    using the GGM, investors can make informed decisions about whether to buy, sell, or hold a
    particular stock.</p>
<h2>Formula</h2>
<p> The formula for the Gordon Growth Model is: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Intrinsic Value = D1 / (r - g) </p>
<p> Where:
<ul>
    <li><strong>D1:</strong> The expected dividend per share for the next year</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> The required rate of return on the stock, also known as the discount
        rate
    </li>
    <li><strong>g:</strong> The expected growth rate of dividends, assumed to be constant over time
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The company pays a constant dividend that grows at a constant rate</li>
    <li>The required rate of return on the stock is constant over time</li>
    <li>The stock is perpetual, meaning it has no maturity date</li>
    <li>The growth rate of dividends is less than the required rate of return</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The model assumes a constant growth rate, which may not be realistic for many companies</li>
    <li>The model assumes a constant required rate of return, which may not be realistic for many
        investors
    </li>
    <li>The model assumes that the company will pay dividends indefinitely, which may not be the
        case for all companies
    </li>
    <li>The model does not take into account changes in the company's capital structure or other
        factors that may affect the stock's value
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p> Suppose a company has an expected dividend per share of $2.00 for the next year, a required rate
    of return on the stock of 10%, and an expected growth rate of dividends of 5%. Using the Gordon
    Growth Model, we can calculate the intrinsic value of the stock as follows: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Intrinsic Value = $2.00 / (0.10 - 0.05) = $40.00 </p>
<p> This means that the stock is undervalued if its current market price is below $40.00 and
    overvalued if its current market price is above $40.00. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> The Gordon Growth Model is a useful tool for estimating the intrinsic value of a stock based on
    its expected future dividends and growth rate. While the model has several limitations, it is
    simple, easy to use, and provides a quick estimate of a stock's intrinsic value. Investors and
    financial analysts can use the GGM as part of their investment analysis and decision-making
    process. </p>
