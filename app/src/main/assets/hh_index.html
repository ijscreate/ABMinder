    <h2>Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)</h2>
    <p>The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a widely used measure of market concentration in
        various fields, including business, economics, political science, finance, and others. It is
        a quantitative measure that regulators use to monitor the potential impact of mergers and
        acquisitions on an industry.</p>
    <p>The HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in an industry and then
        summing the resulting numbers. The formula for calculating the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is
        as follows:</p>
    <p>HHI = S1<sup>2</sup> + S2<sup>2</sup> + ... + Sn<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Where S1, S2, etc., refer to the percentage market share that various companies hold in the
        given industry.</p>
    <p>The HHI ranges from 1 (least concentrated) to 10,000 (most concentrated). An HHI of less than
        1,500 represents an industry with low market concentration, while an HHI ranging between
        1,500 and 2,500 represents moderate concentration. HHI values of more than 2,500 represent a
        highly concentrated industry.</p>
    <p>The HHI is used to monitor the potential impact of mergers and acquisitions on an industry,
        and it is a quantitative measure that regulators can cite to veto an M&A transaction.
        Companies can also include the index in their M&A proposals to indicate that the merger
        would not lead to a monopolistic market.</p>
    <p>In the Philippines, the HHI is used to assess the degree of concentration of an industry. For
        example, in the case of an industry with a HHI of 2,036, it is classified as a moderately
        concentrated industry. Further mergers and acquisitions led by a particular firm could
        potentially raise the HHI by more than 200 points and even push the index to over 2,500,
        indicating a highly concentrated industry.</p>
