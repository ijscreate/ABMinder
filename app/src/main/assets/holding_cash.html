<h2>Holding Cash</h2>

<div class="definition">
    <h3>Cash</h3>
    <p>Being the most liquid asset, cash is an important account in the balance sheet that will
        affect the liquidity, and solvency of a company. It is also the most vulnerable when it
        comes to theft.</p>
    <p>A good internal control must be properly implemented to safeguard this asset:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A basic internal control system entails the assignment of custodial function and
            recording function to separate individuals, unless you are the owner. Why is this so?
            Imagine a cashier of a company who is also the chief accountant. If tempted, this person
            can steal cash from the company and can manipulate the records so that nobody can
            discover that he is stealing. If you are the owner, you probably will not steal from
            yourself and adjust the records?
        </li>
        <li>Cash collections should be supported by official receipts which are summarized in a
            daily collection report. The daily collection report is going to useful for the next
            control measure for cash – depositing collections.
        </li>
        <li>A good internal control over cash is by depositing all collections intact. The daily
            collection reports are now compared with the deposit slips to find out if all
            collections are indeed deposited.
        </li>
        <li>If all collections need to be deposited, then payments must be made through a check
            voucher system. There must also be two signatories in the check to provide a check and
            balance. If the business is small then the entrepreneur’s signature may suffice.
        </li>
        <li>For small payments like the fare given to a messenger, a petty cash fund is used. A
            petty cash fund which should be minimal in amount, will be issued to a petty cash fund
            custodian, say the office administrator. The petty cash fund may be PHP10,000 or
            PHP20,000. Disbursements from this petty cash funds must be supported by a petty cash
            voucher signed by the recipient of the petty cash. When the petty cash fund is almost
            depleted, the petty cash fund custodian will get reimbursements. This reimbursement will
            go through the check voucher system where the custodian gets a check with the petty cash
            vouchers as supporting documents.
        </li>
        <li>The check must also be cross-checked by drawing two lines on the payee section of the
            check. This cross-checking requires depositing of a check. It cannot be encashed. This
            makes it more difficult for somebody who stole a check to get the money.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <h3>Motives For Holding Cash</h3>
    <p>The following are the reasons for holding cash:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Reasons</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Transactional. This is the cash used for paying expenses such as salaries,
                utilities, rent and taxes, among others.
            </li>
            <li>Compensating balance. This is the cash held to meet bank requirements such as the
                minimum cash balance you maintain for checking accounts and if you have existing
                loans, banks may also require a minimum amount of deposit with them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Secondary Reasons</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Precautionary. This is the cash maintained for emergencies such as the additional
                cash you keep during political and economic uncertainties. For example, if your
                business requires a substantial amount of importation, a relatively higher amount of
                cash has to be maintained when the exchange rate becomes highly volatile due to
                political instability such as what happened during EDSA II.
            </li>
            <li>Speculative. This refers to the cash held by the company to take advantage of
                opportunities (e.g. buying stocks during major corrections such as what happened at
                the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 where stock valuations
                went down by as much as 80% for some companies).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <h3>Budgeting Cash</h3>
    <p>The Cash Budget</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The cash budget provides information regarding the company’s expected cash receipts and
            disbursements over a given period.
        </li>
        <li>It is useful for identifying future funding requirements or excess cash within a given
            period. This allows managers to find possible sources of financing if the cash budget
            shows cash shortage or identify appropriate tenors for money market placements for
            excess cash.
        </li>
        <li>Normally, a cash budget is prepared for a one-year period broken down into smaller
            intervals like months. This allows managers to see the seasonality of the business which
            affects the cash flows.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Basically, cash budget has the following parts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cash Receipts include all of a firm’s inflows of cash in a given financial period. The
            most common components of cash receipts are cash sales, collections of accounts
            receivable, and other cash receipts.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="example">
    <h3 style="text-align: center">Example Scenario: Holding Cash</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Cash Management:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>John ensures that his cash register always has sufficient change to provide to
                customers.
            </li>
            <li>He separates the responsibilities of handling cash and recording transactions. His
                cashier is responsible for handling cash, while John or another employee is
                responsible for recording transactions in the accounting system.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Petty Cash Fund:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>John maintains a petty cash fund of PHP 10,000 to cover small expenses like
                purchasing office supplies or reimbursing employees for minor expenses.
            </li>
            <li>The petty cash fund is kept in a secure location, and John designates an office
                administrator as the custodian responsible for managing the fund.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Daily Cash Deposits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At the end of each business day, John deposits the day's cash sales into the
                company's bank account.
            </li>
            <li>He compares the total cash collected, as recorded in the daily sales report, with
                the deposit slip to ensure accuracy and completeness.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Check Payments:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For larger payments, such as paying suppliers or utility bills, John uses a check
                voucher system.
            </li>
            <li>He ensures that each check is signed by two authorized signatories to provide a
                check and balance mechanism.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Cross-Checking Checks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To prevent check fraud, John draws two lines on the payee section of each check,
                making it non-negotiable.
            </li>
            <li>This measure ensures that stolen checks cannot be easily cashed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Motives for Holding Cash:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>John holds cash for primary reasons such as covering daily operational expenses like
                salaries and utility bills.
            </li>
            <li>He also maintains a compensating balance in his business checking account to meet
                the bank's requirements.
            </li>
            <li>Additionally, John holds cash for precautionary reasons, such as having extra funds
                on hand during economic uncertainties or when facing unexpected expenses like
                equipment repairs.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>This example demonstrates how John manages cash effectively in his retail business,
            implementing various strategies outlined in the concept of holding cash to ensure
            financial security and operational efficiency.</p>
