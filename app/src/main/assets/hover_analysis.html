    <h2>Horizontal Analysis vs Vertical Analysis</h2>
</header>
<div class="container"><h3>What is Horizontal Analysis?</h3>
    <p>Horizontal analysis, also known as trend analysis, is a financial analysis technique used to
        compare financial data over different periods of time. The primary goal of this analysis is
        to identify trends and patterns that can provide insights into the company's financial
        health and performance. By examining financial data over multiple reporting periods,
        horizontal analysis can help management and investors understand how a company's financial
        position has changed over time.</p>
    <p>Horizontal analysis typically involves comparing financial figures such as revenues,
        expenses, and net income across several reporting periods. For instance, a company might use
        horizontal analysis to compare its revenues for the past five years to determine whether its
        revenue is increasing, decreasing, or remaining relatively stable over time. Similarly, it
        can analyze the trend in expenses to identify any significant changes or fluctuations that
        might impact the company's profitability.</p>
    <p>This analysis can also be presented in a table or graph format, making it easier to visualize
        and interpret the data. By analyzing the trends in financial data, management can make
        informed decisions about the company's operations and financial strategy. For instance, if a
        company notices a decline in revenue over time, it might decide to invest in marketing or
        product development to boost sales. Similarly, if expenses are increasing faster than
        revenue, the company might need to cut costs or find ways to increase revenue to maintain
        profitability.</p>
    <p>In summary, horizontal analysis is a valuable tool for financial analysis that can provide
        insights into a company's financial health and performance over time. By examining trends in
        financial data, management and investors can make informed decisions about the company's
        financial strategy and operations.</p>

        <p>Horizontal analysis compares financial data over time, such as comparing revenue,
            expenses, and net income from year to year. In this example, we compare the financial
            performance of the company in 2021 and 2022, showing the peso amount change and
            percentage change for each line item.</p>

<div class="container"><h3>What is Vertical Analysis?</h3>
    <p>Vertical analysis, also known as common-size analysis, is a financial analysis technique used
        to compare different components of financial statements to a key metric, typically total
        revenue or total assets. This method involves expressing each line item as a percentage of a
        base figure, allowing for easy comparison across different companies or industries. Vertical
        analysis helps in understanding the composition and proportion of various elements within a
        financial statement.</p>
    <p>For instance, vertical analysis of an income statement would express each expense category
        (e.g., cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses) as a percentage of total
        revenue. By expressing each expense as a percentage of total revenue, management and
        investors can assess the relative importance of each expense category in relation to the
        company's total revenue. This analysis can help identify any significant changes or trends
        in expenses, allowing management to make informed decisions about the company's operations
        and financial strategy.</p>
    <p>Similarly, a vertical analysis of a balance sheet would express each asset and liability
        category as a percentage of total assets or total liabilities and equity. This analysis
        helps in understanding the composition of a company's assets and liabilities, providing
        insights into the company's financial structure and liquidity.</p>
    <p>Vertical analysis can be useful in several ways, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comparing financial statements across different companies or industries, even if the
            companies have different scales of operations.
        </li>
        <li>Identifying trends and changes in financial statement items over time.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the composition and proportion of various elements within a financial
            statement.
        </li>
        <li>Providing insights into a company's financial structure and liquidity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, vertical analysis is a valuable tool for financial analysis that can provide
        insights into the composition and proportion of various elements within a financial
        statement. By expressing each line item as a percentage of a base figure, vertical analysis
        allows for easy comparison across different companies or industries, helping management and
        investors make informed decisions about the company's operations and financial strategy.</p>

        <p>Vertical analysis expresses each line item in a financial statement as a percentage of
            another line item, typically revenue or total assets. In this example, we analyze the
            income statement for the year 2022, expressing each line item as a percentage of
            revenue. This allows us to compare the relative importance of each line item in the
            income statement, regardless of the peso value.</p>

    <h3>Horizontal analysis vs. Vertical analysis</h3>
    <p>Altogether, there are a few main similarities between horizontal analysis and vertical
        analysis, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Both horizontal and vertical analysis can be used by internal and external
            stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>Both forms of analysis can help you pick out trends and patterns in financial data and
            develop strategies.
        </li>
        <li>Both forms of analysis can help you analyze various financial statements, including
            balance sheets and income statements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, there are also some differences between the two that are important to understand.
        The primary differences between horizontal and vertical analysis include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Horizontal analysis is performed horizontally across time periods, while vertical
            analysis is performed vertically inside of a column.
        </li>
        <li>Horizontal analysis represents changes over years or periods, while vertical analysis
            represents amounts as percentages of a base figure.
        </li>
        <li>Horizontal analysis usually examines many reporting periods, while vertical analysis
            typically focuses on one reporting period.
        </li>
        <li>Horizontal analysis can help you compare a company's current financial status to its
            past status, while vertical analysis can help you compare one company's financial status
            to another's.
        </li>
    </ul>
