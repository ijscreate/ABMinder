    <h2>Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

    <p>The macro environment consists of external factors that influence a company's
        decision-making, including economic, politico-legal, sociocultural, demographic,
        technological, and natural factors.</p>

    <p>Here are the strengths and weaknesses associated with each factor:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Strengths include the potential for economic growth,
            which can lead to increased consumer spending and business opportunities. Weaknesses
            include economic downturns, which can reduce consumer purchasing power and affect
            company revenues negatively.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Politico-Legal Factors:</strong> Strengths include stable political environments
            that foster business growth and development. Weaknesses include political instability or
            unfavorable government policies that can hinder operations and increase regulatory
            compliance costs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sociocultural Factors:</strong> Strengths include understanding consumer
            preferences and adapting products or services to meet societal needs. Weaknesses include
            cultural barriers or shifts in societal values that may impact consumer behavior and
            demand for certain products.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Demographic Factors:</strong> Strengths include access to diverse markets and
            demographic segments. Weaknesses include aging populations or declining birth rates that
            may reduce market size or alter consumer preferences.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Technological Factors:</strong> Strengths include innovation that can lead to
            product development and efficiency gains. Weaknesses include rapid technological
            advancements that may require significant investment to stay competitive.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Natural Factors:</strong> Strengths include access to natural resources that
            support production processes. Weaknesses include environmental regulations or natural
            disasters that can disrupt operations and increase costs.
        </li>
    </ul>
