<h2>IMPACT OF BELIEF SYSTEMS</h2>

<p>In an increasingly secular world, some may question the need to study the religious foundations
    of business ethics. But there are many reasons to do so, not least of which is the important
    part religion plays in many people’s lives. For believers, religious teachings not only provide
    a map for life but also help them navigate issues that arise in the workplace. Many current
    philosophical theories, which consider the implications of business activities for the
    community, also have a wider focus than many current philosophical theories. This helps to ease
    problems associated with the idea of business as an enterprise without values. In this lesson,
    you will touch on some of the biggest religious denominations and how their teachings affect the
    world of business.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO CHRISTIANITY</h3>

<p>Christianity has over 2 billion followers who classify themselves under 34,000 different
    denominations. Initially, Christianity was derived from Judaism. Why? " Because Jesus Christ was
    a Jew, and so were his twelve disciples. The religion is based principally on the life, death,
    and resurrection of Jesus Christ. With Christians believing in only one God, the religion is
    also monotheistic. Christians believe the Bible is the word of God, and although some choose to
    take it more literally than others, it is generally considered to be inspired by the Holy
    Spirit.</p>
<h4>Who Was Jesus Christ?</h4>

<p>Jesus was born circa 6 B.C. in Bethlehem. His mother, Mary, was a virgin who was betrothed to
    Joseph, a carpenter. Christians believe Jesus was born through the Immaculate Conception. His
    lineage can be traced back to the house of David. According to the Gospel of Matthew (2:1),
    Jesus was born during the reign of Herod the Great, who, upon hearing of his birth, felt
    threatened and tried to kill Jesus by ordering all of Bethlehem’s male children under age two to
    be killed. But Joseph was warned by an angel and took Mary and the child to Egypt until Herod’s
    death, whereupon he brought the family back and settled in the town of Nazareth, in Galilee.</p>

<p>By the power of God, Jesus performed many miracles on Earth, including healing disease, bringing
    dead people back to life, casting out demons, controlling the weather, walking on water, turning
    water into wine, etc. Jesus Christ taught humankind to love God as God loved them. He preached
    the gospel of the kingdom of God. And those who believed in Jesus and did the will of God would
    enter his kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ was scourged, mocked, and hung on a cross, and crucified around 33 CE in Jerusalem.
    Christians believe that God sent his Son to Earth to save men from the consequences of their
    sins. Jesus Christ was then raised from the dead and appeared to his disciples as the Savior
    foretold of in the Old Testament. Jesus ascended into heaven where Jesus Christ reigns with God
    the Father. Christians believe that He will return someday to judge the living and the dead and
    to grant eternal life to His followers. The Holy Spirit was sent to earth to comfort the
    believers; they were saved and filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Jesus is also known as the Son of God, Light of the World, Lamb of God, and Good Shepherd.</p>

<h4>CHRISTIAN BELIEFS</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>One God</strong> - Christianity has always been monotheistic, meaning that we
        believe in one God.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Justification By Faith</strong> - In Christianity, the belief is that a person can
        achieve salvation (see also salvation) only through faith and reliance on God's grace, not
        through good deeds. The phrase is adapted from a sentence in the epistles of Paul in the
        Bible (see also Bible): “By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
        is the gift of God.”
    </li>
    <li><strong>Eternal Life</strong> – Christians believe that there is life after death. Heaven is
        the final destination of believers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Saints</strong> - Saints are the heroes of the Catholic faith. They lived lives in
        holiness, dedicated to serving God and spreading His message of salvation.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>IMPACTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN BUSINESS PRACTICES</h4>

<p>Christians celebrate God in a variety of ways, including worship, evangelism, almsgiving, faith,
    and imitating God's activities. As seen in the example below, a Christian can integrate his or
    her values with his or her business activities.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>In the manufacturing of goods</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>God intended for people to develop the Earth by providing the knowledge and skills necessary to
    create something out of the ingredients provided by God. When the focus is on getting material
    things, however, there are temptations that accompany the production of goods and services.
    Pride may also tempt one to turn one's heart away from their neighbors. Christians are
    instructed to eschew greed and selfishness. It is forbidden to produce dangerous, bad, or
    destructive work, such as narcotics or pornography.</p>

<ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Employing somebody and being employed are two different things.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The bible does not consider hiring someone else to be exploitation. In the Bible, Jesus teaches
    that employees are entitled to pay and that employers benefit from having the work completed.
    Employers must be careful not to oppress or be unfair to their employees. Employees, on the
    other hand, must be cautious to avoid work-related carelessness, sloth, jealousy, bitterness,
    dishonesty, theft, or rebellion.</p>

<ol start="3">
    <li><strong>When purchasing and selling</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Commercial transactions are beneficial in and of themselves since the community can assist and
    meet the needs of one another. Christians must be wary of seeking solely their good and ignoring
    the needs of others. Selfishness must be overcome. It is not the Christian way to amass a
    fortune at the expense of others.</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Profitable Earnings</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The bible teaches about stewardship, which is expanding or multiplying the possessions provided
    to humans by God. Profit-seeking is inherently beneficial, but it must be ensured that the
    profits are not obtained via the exploitation of others or by unethical business methods.</p>

<p>Christians have the chance to copy God's character and honor Him in whatever they do by
    reflecting God's traits of love for others, knowledge, and so on.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO ISLAM</h3>

<p>The Prophet Muhammad was the founder of Islam. Islam means "surrender," and its central concept
    is to submit to God's will. "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is his messenger," it states
    as its basic belief.</p>

<p>Muslims are those who follow Islam. Muslims believe that they are following in the footsteps of
    the Judeo-Christian prophets Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, whom they consider to be key
    prophets before Muhammad.</p>

<p>The Qur'an, Islam's sacred book, has very little information on Muhammad's life; but, the
    hadiths, or Prophet's sayings, which were mostly recorded in the years after Muhammad's death,
    provide a more detailed account of his life's events (although there is significant debate in
    the Muslim world as to which Hadiths are accurate).</p>

<h4>IMPACTS OF MUSLIM IN BUSINESS PRACTICES</h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Practice freedom enterprise</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Within the constraints of the Islamic Shari'ah, Muslims are free to select how they want to make
    a living. To pursue lawful and just business, one must work with a feeling of
    responsibility.</p>

<ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Be honest and truthful</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Any misbehavior is condemned by the Quran. To improve or exaggerate qualities during product
    presentation, one must aim to earn through genuine transactions. Sincerity and purity of intent
    are encouraged in Islam. Avoid using deception, fraud, or other dubious methods to promote your
    products.</p>

<ol start="3">
    <li><strong>Trade through mutual consent.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Mutual consent is required for a transaction to be valid. In Islam, sales legally enforceable are
    prohibited. Exploitation and usury are both prohibited because they take advantage of others'
    situations.</p>

<ol start="4">
    <li><strong>Treat workers fairly</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Islam promotes a brotherly relationship between employer and employee. It is the employer's moral
    responsibility to look after the well-being of his or her employees. They should be paid fairly
    and work in pleasant settings.</p>

<ol start="5">
    <li><strong>Keep one’s word</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Muslims must honor and carry out their contractual obligations. Contracts must clearly explain
    the facts and openly identify the rights and obligations of the parties involved, according to
    Islamic beliefs.</p>

<ol start="6">
    <li><strong>Be humble.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>One should live one's life in conformity with Allah's instructions. In all transactions, Muslims
    should avoid excess and show goodwill.</p>

<ol start="7">
    <li><strong>Seek halal earnings</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Muslims must generate halal money, not merely money from any business. Dealing with harams
    (illegal) items such as dead meat, pigs, and idols is forbidden for Muslims. They are also
    forbidden from selling speculative or dangerous goods. Muslims must refrain from engaging in
    riba regardless of the profits (interest usury). Matters in business dealings were prohibited
    under the shari'ah list. Businesspeople should treat others in the same way that they would want
    to be treated.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM</h3>

<p>In what is now contemporary India, Buddhism developed into an organized religion practiced by
    monks, nuns, and laypeople. Its beliefs were documented, resulting in a huge canon. Buddhist
    images were also created with the intention of being worshipped in sacred areas. From India,
    Buddhism expanded throughout Asia. To appreciate Buddha's accomplishment, we must imagine what
    life was like in early India, particularly in towns and villages along the Ganges River Valley,
    such as Kapilavastu in the foothills of the Himalayan highlands, in what is now Nepal.</p>

<p>This is where the Buddha was most likely born, around 560 B.C.E. The river inundates the valley
    every year, killing crops. Every year, the monsoons arrive, causing starvation. Droughts were
    also harsh, as were diseases like dysentery and cholera.</p>

<h4>IMPACTS OF BUDDHISM IN BUSINESS PRACTICES</h4>

<p>The primary principle of Buddhism is to not harm. An examination will reveal that Buddhism has a
    favorable impact on business methods. This instruction also serves as a reminder to Buddhists to
    maintain a balance between hard effort and overwork. Mindfulness can be beneficial to a company
    since it allows people to operate more efficiently. Both the head and the heart must be
    balanced, objective, and self-aware.</p>

<p>Nonexploitation is a fundamental Buddhist concept. It emphasizes that no connection between what
    is given and what is received is required. People, on the other hand, negotiate in real life to
    obtain the most for their money. Exploitation is defined as withholding good control of supply
    and then selling the commodities at a high price.</p>
