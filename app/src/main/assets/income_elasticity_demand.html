    <h2>Income Elasticity of Demand</h2>
    <p>Income elasticity of demand is a concept that measures the responsiveness of the quantity
        demanded of a good or service to changes in consumer income. It helps to understand how
        sensitive the demand for a particular product is to changes in income levels of
        consumers.</p>
    <h3>Formula</h3>
    <p>The formula for income elasticity of demand is:</p>
    <p><em>Income Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Categories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Income Elasticity > 1 (Elastic):</strong> If the income elasticity of demand is
            greater than 1, it is considered elastic. This means that the percentage change in
            quantity demanded is proportionally greater than the percentage change in income. In
            this case, as consumer income rises, the demand for the good increases at a faster rate.
            Examples include luxury goods or goods for which there are plenty of substitutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Income Elasticity < 1 (Inelastic):</strong> If the income elasticity of demand
            is less than 1, it is considered inelastic. This implies that the percentage change in
            quantity demanded is proportionally less than the percentage change in income. In this
            scenario, as consumer income rises, the demand for the good increases, but at a slower
            rate. Examples include basic necessities or goods that have few substitutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Income Elasticity = 1 (Unitary Elastic):</strong> If the income elasticity of
            demand is 1, it is considered unitary elastic. This means that the percentage change in
            quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in income.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Significance</h3>
    <p>The income elasticity of demand helps businesses and economists understand how changes in
        income levels impact consumer demand for goods and services. It provides insights into
        whether a good is a normal good (demand increases with an increase in income) or an inferior
        good (demand decreases with an increase in income). This information is valuable for
        businesses to make informed decisions about their products and pricing strategies, as well
        as to forecast demand changes based on changes in consumer income levels.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Suppose you are analyzing the demand for smartphones in a specific market. You want to
        determine the income elasticity of demand for smartphones in that market. Here's the data
        you gather:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Market A experienced a 10% increase in average consumer income.</li>
        <li>The quantity demanded of smartphones in Market A increased by 15% in response to the
            income increase.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using the formula for income elasticity of demand:</p>
    <p><em>Income Elasticity of Demand = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) / (% Change in Income)</em>
    </p>
    <p><em>Income Elasticity of Demand = (15%)/(10%)</em></p>
    <p><em>Income Elasticity of Demand = 1.5</em></p>
    <p>In this case, the income elasticity of demand for smartphones in Market A is 1.5, which
        indicates elastic demand. This means that a 1% increase in consumer income will lead to a
        1.5% increase in the quantity demanded of smartphones.</p>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>The interpretation of this result is that smartphones are a relatively elastic good in this
        market. As consumer income increases, the demand for smartphones grows at a proportionally
        higher rate. People consider smartphones as discretionary items and are more likely to
        increase their spending on smartphones as their income rises.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that the income elasticity of demand can vary across different goods
        and markets. Each product or service will have its own unique income elasticity based on
        consumer preferences, income levels, and the nature of the good.</p>
