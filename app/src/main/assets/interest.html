<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>Interest plays a crucial role in finance and economics, influencing borrowing, lending, saving,
    and investing decisions. It refers to the cost of borrowing money or the compensation received
    for lending money, typically expressed as a percentage of the principal amount.</p>
<p>Here are key concepts related to interest:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The original amount of money borrowed or invested.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> The percentage of the principal amount charged as interest
        or earned as return over a specific period.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Simple Interest:</strong> Interest calculated only on the initial principal, without
        compounding.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Compound Interest:</strong> Interest calculated on the initial principal and also on
        the accumulated interest from previous periods, leading to exponential growth.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR):</strong> The annual rate charged for borrowing or
        earned through an investment, inclusive of fees and other charges.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Effective Annual Rate (EAR):</strong> The annual rate of interest that accounts for
        compounding effects and reflects the true cost of borrowing or the true return on
        investment.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fixed vs. Variable Interest Rates:</strong> Fixed rates remain constant throughout
        the loan or investment period, while variable rates may change periodically based on market
        conditions.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the return earned on a savings account. It is
    typically expressed as a percentage of the principal amount, which is the original amount of
    money borrowed or deposited. Interest can be calculated using simple interest or compound
    interest formulas.</p>


<p><strong>Simple Interest Formula:</strong></p>
<p><code>I = P * r * t</code></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>I:</strong> Simple interest</li>
    <li><strong>P:</strong> Principal amount</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> Interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
    <li><strong>t:</strong> Time (usually in years)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compound Interest Formula:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A:</strong> Future value of the investment/loan</li>
    <li><strong>P:</strong> Principal amount</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> Interest rate (as a decimal)</li>
    <li><strong>m:</strong> Number of times interest is compounded per year</li>
    <li><strong>t:</strong> Time (usually in years)</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing loans or investments with different compounding frequencies, it's useful to
    calculate the effective annual rate (EAR), which is the annual rate that would produce the same
    future value if interest were compounded once per year. The formula for calculating the EAR
    is:</p>
<p><code>EAR = (1 + r/m)^m - 1</code></p>
<p>Interest is an important concept in finance and is used to calculate the cost of borrowing money
    or the return earned on savings. Understanding how interest is calculated can help individuals
    make informed decisions about loans, savings accounts, and other financial products.</p>
