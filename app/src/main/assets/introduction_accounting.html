    <h2>Introduction to Accounting</h2>
</header>
<main>
    <p>Accounting is the process of recording, summarizing, analyzing, and reporting financial
        transactions of a business or organization. It provides insights into the financial health
        and performance of a company, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.</p>

    <p>Key aspects of accounting include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recording:</strong> Accounting involves systematically recording financial
            transactions, such as sales, purchases, and expenses, in an organized manner.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Summarizing:</strong> Once transactions are recorded, they are summarized into
            financial statements, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow
            statement, which provide an overview of the company's financial position and
            performance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analyzing:</strong> Accountants analyze financial data to identify trends,
            patterns, and areas of concern. They may use various financial ratios and metrics to
            assess the company's performance and compare it to industry benchmarks.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Finally, accounting involves preparing and presenting
            financial reports to stakeholders, including investors, creditors, regulators, and
            management. These reports provide transparency and accountability, allowing stakeholders
            to evaluate the company's financial health and make informed decisions.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Why Accounting is Important:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Financial Statements:</strong> Accounting provides financial statements that
                summarize a company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. These
                statements are used by investors, creditors, and regulatory agencies to make
                informed decisions about the financial health and performance of a company.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Compliance:</strong> Accounting ensures compliance with financial
                regulations and laws. Financial accountants follow generally accepted accounting
                principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS) to prepare
                financial statements. Tax accountants follow the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and
                regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing
                authorities to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decision Making:</strong> Accounting provides financial information that is
                used to make informed decisions. Financial statements, budgets, forecasts, and
                financial analysis tools are used by management to make strategic decisions about
                pricing, production, and profitability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transparency:</strong> Accounting provides transparency to stakeholders.
                Financial statements and reports provide a clear picture of a company's financial
                position, performance, and cash flows. This transparency helps build trust and
                credibility with stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and regulatory
                agencies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Accounting helps manage risk by providing
                financial information that is used to identify and mitigate risks. Financial
                analysis tools, such as variance analysis and sensitivity analysis, are used to
                identify risks and opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Accounting is used in strategic planning by
                providing financial information that is used to make informed decisions about the
                future direction of a company. Budgets, forecasts, and financial projections are
                used to develop strategic plans and goals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Communication:</strong> Accounting is used to communicate financial
                information to stakeholders. Financial statements, reports, and presentations are
                used to communicate financial information to investors, creditors, regulatory
                agencies, and other stakeholders.
            </li>

        <h3>What Are the Different Types of Accounting?
        </h3>
        <h4>Financial Accounting:</h4>
        <p>Financial accounting refers to the processes used to generate interim and annual
            financial statements. The results of all financial transactions that occur during an
            accounting period are summarized in the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow
            statement. The financial statements of most companies are audited annually by an
            external CPA firm. For some, such as publicly-traded companies, audits are a legal
            requirement. However, lenders also typically require the results of an external audit
            annually as part of their debt covenants. Therefore, most companies will have annual
            audits for one reason or another. Financial accounting is governed by generally accepted
            accounting principles (GAAP) and international financial reporting standards (IFRS) in
            different countries. The goal of financial accounting is to provide financial
            information to external stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and regulatory
            agencies, to make informed decisions about the financial health and performance of a
            company.</p>

        <h4>Managerial Accounting:</h4>
        <p>Managerial accounting uses much of the same data as financial accounting, but it
            organizes and utilizes information in different ways. Namely, in managerial accounting,
            an accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business's management team
            can use to make decisions about how the business operates. Managerial accounting also
            encompasses many other facets of accounting, including budgeting, forecasting, and
            various financial analysis tools. Essentially, any information that may be useful to
            management falls underneath this umbrella. Managerial accounting is not governed by GAAP
            or IFRS, but rather by the needs of the management team. The goal of managerial
            accounting is to provide financial information to internal stakeholders, such as
            managers and business owners, to make informed decisions about the operations and
            performance of a company.</p>

        <h4>Cost Accounting:</h4>
        <p>Cost accounting is a subset of managerial accounting that focuses on determining the
            costs associated with producing a product or providing a service. Cost accountants use
            various methods, such as activity-based costing and job order costing, to allocate costs
            to products or services. The goal of cost accounting is to provide financial information
            to management to make informed decisions about pricing, production, and profitability.
            Cost accountants also work with management to develop budgets and forecasts, and to
            identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency.</p>

        <h4>Tax Accounting:</h4>
        <p>While financial accountants often use one set of rules to report the financial position
            of a company, tax accountants often use a different set of rules. These rules are set at
            the federal, state, or local level based on what return is being filed. Tax accounts
            balance compliance with reporting rules while also attempting to minimize a company's
            tax liability through thoughtful strategic decision-making. A tax accountant often
            oversees the entire tax process of a company: the strategic creation of the organization
            chart, the operations, the compliance, the reporting, and the remittance of tax
            liability. Tax accounting is governed by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and regulations
            issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities. The goal of
            tax accounting is to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations while minimizing a
            company's tax liability.</p>

        <h3>History of Accounting</h3>
        <p>It is believed that the history of accounting dates back thousands of years and can be
            traced to ancient civilizations. One of the earliest developments of accounting is
            thought to have occurred in ancient Mesopotamia, where people followed systems of
            writing and counting money, likely related to taxation and trading activities of
            temples.</p>
        <p>More evidence of the development of accounting can be found during the reign of Emperor
            Augustus (63BC—14AD) in ancient Rome. Detailed financial information regarding the
            stewardship of Roman resources was recorded, including public revenues, treasury
            amounts, and tax officials' records, in documents such as the Res Gestae Divi
            Augusti.</p>
        <p>A significant milestone in accounting history occurred in fourteenth-century Italy with
            the dissemination of double-entry bookkeeping by Luca Pacioli. Pacioli is often referred
            to as the father of modern accounting due to his work. The double-entry bookkeeping
            system, which records both debits and credits for each transaction, was introduced in
            Pacioli's Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita.</p>
        <p>The modern profession of the chartered accountant originated in Scotland in the
            nineteenth century with the granting of a royal charter to the Institute of Accountants
            in Glasgow by Queen Victoria. Today, accounting standards such as the Philippine
            Financial Reporting Standard (PFRS) and the Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) guide
            accountants in their practice of the profession.</p>
