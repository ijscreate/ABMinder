    <b>Introduction:</b>
    <br><br>
    Inventory Turnover is a fundamental financial ratio that measures how efficiently a company
    manages its inventory. It provides valuable insights into the frequency with which a company
    sells and replenishes its inventory during a specific period.
    <br><br>
    <b>Formula:</b>
    <br><br>
    The Inventory Turnover ratio is calculated using the following formula:
    <br><br>
    <i>Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory</i>
    <br><br>
    <b>Key Components:</b>
    <br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</b> The total direct costs associated with the production of
        goods or services that have been sold during a specific period.
    </li>
    <li><b>Average Inventory:</b> The average value of the inventory during the same period,
        calculated by adding the beginning and ending inventory values and dividing by 2.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Interpretation of Inventory Turnover:</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>High Ratio:</b> A high inventory turnover ratio indicates efficient inventory management,
        quick sales, and minimal holding costs. It suggests that the company is effectively selling
        and restocking its inventory.
    </li>
    <li><b>Low Ratio:</b> A low inventory turnover ratio may suggest overstocking, slow-moving
        inventory, or potential obsolescence. It could imply that the company is struggling to turn
        its inventory into sales quickly.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Examples:</b>
<br><br>
<p><b>Example 1:</b> Company ABC has a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) of $2,000,000 and an Average
    Inventory of $500,000.</p>
<p>Inventory Turnover = $2,000,000 / $500,000 = 4</p>
<p>This means that Company ABC, on average, sells and replenishes its inventory four times within
    the specified period.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Example 2:</b> Company XYZ has a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) of $1,000,000 and an Average
    Inventory of $250,000.</p>
<p>Inventory Turnover = $1,000,000 / $250,000 = 4</p>
<p>Similar to Company ABC, Company XYZ also has an inventory turnover ratio of 4, suggesting a
    comparable efficiency in managing inventory.</p>

<b>Importance of Inventory Turnover:</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> Reflects how well a company manages its inventory to meet
        customer demand and avoid unnecessary holding costs.
    </li>
    <li><b>Working Capital Management:</b> Efficient inventory turnover helps optimize working
        capital and improves cash flow, as less capital is tied up in unsold inventory.
    </li>
    <li><b>Financial Health Indicator:</b> Provides insights into the overall financial health and
        efficiency of the supply chain.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Considerations and Limitations:</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Industry Differences:</b> Ideal inventory turnover ratios vary across industries, and
        comparisons should be made within the same industry.
    </li>
    <li><b>Seasonal Variations:</b> Seasonal businesses may experience fluctuations in inventory
        turnover, and adjustments may be needed for accurate analysis.
    </li>
    <li><b>Quality of Sales:</b> The ratio does not distinguish between high-margin and low-margin
        products; additional analysis may be required.
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Conclusion:</b>
<br><br>
Inventory Turnover is a crucial metric for assessing a company's ability to manage its inventory
efficiently and sustainably. A balanced and industry-appropriate ratio contributes to better
financial performance and competitiveness.
