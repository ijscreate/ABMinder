    <h2>Investing Activities</h2>
    <p>Investing activities are a crucial part of a company's financial operations, and they are
        reported on the cash flow statement. These activities include the purchase and sale of
        long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as well as investments in
        securities or other businesses. The cash flow statement is divided into three sections: cash
        flow from operating activities (CFO), cash flow from investing activities (CFI), and cash
        flow from financing activities (CFF). The CFI section specifically tracks the cash inflows
        and outflows related to fixed assets and long-term investments across a specific period.</p>
    <p>Investing activities can include purchases of long-term assets, such as property, plant, and
        equipment (PP&E), investments in marketable securities such as stocks and bonds, and
        acquisitions of other businesses. The formula for calculating the cash from investing
        section is as follows: Cash Flow from Investing Activities =(Capital Expenditures) +
        (Purchase of Long-Term Investments) + (Business Acquisitions) â€“ Divestitures. The
        parentheses above are meant to denote that the respective item should be entered as a
        negative value (i.e. cash outflow). In particular, Capex is typically the largest cash
        outflow and is a core, recurring expenditure to the business model.</p>
    <p>Positive CFI indicates that the company is divesting its assets, which increases the cash
        balance of the company, while negative CFI means that the company is likely investing
        heavily into its fixed asset base to generate revenue growth in the coming years. A negative
        cash flow from investing activities is not a sign of concern, as it implies management is
        investing in the long-term growth of the company.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Investing Activities:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Purchase of fixed assets (e.g., machinery or equipment)</li>
        <li>Investments in marketable securities (e.g., stocks or bonds)</li>
        <li>Acquisitions of other businesses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Investing activities are important for a company's growth and capital, and analysts will look
        at the investing section of the cash flow statement to monitor how much the company is
        spending on PP&E. Capital expenditures (CapEx) are a popular way in which stocks are valued,
        as they indicate that the company is investing in future operations and is in a good
        financial position.</p>
    <p>Operating activities and investing activities are two different categories of transactions
        that a company engages in, and they are reported separately in a company's cash flow
        statement.</p>
    <p>Operating Activities</p>
    <p>Operating activities refer to the transactions that a company engages in as part of its
        day-to-day operations, such as sales, administration, marketing, and other activities that
        are directly linked to the company's profitability. These activities generate the majority
        of the cash flows for the company, and they determine the profitability of the company.
        Operating activities include all the transactions used in determining net income, having a
        cash effect. Examples of operating activities include collecting accounts receivable, paying
        accounts payable, and paying salaries and wages.</p>
    <p>Investing Activities</p>
    <p>Investing activities, on the other hand, refer to the transactions that a company engages in
        related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets, such as property, plant, and
        equipment, and investments in other businesses or securities. These activities are not
        directly linked with the current profitability of the company, but they help the company
        function in the long haul. Examples of investing activities include the purchase of
        property, plant, and equipment, acquisitions of other businesses, and investments in
        marketable securities.</p>
    <p>The Difference</p>
    <p>The main difference between operating activities and investing activities is that operating
        activities are related to the core business operations of the company, while investing
        activities are related to the long-term growth and expansion of the company. Operating
        activities are focused on generating cash flows from the company's primary business
        activities, while investing activities are focused on investing in long-term assets or other
        businesses that will generate cash flows in the future.</p>
