<h3>What is Investing?</h3>
<p>Investing is the act of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of generating
    income or profit. It involves purchasing financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual
    funds, or real estate, with the goal of increasing wealth over time.</p>

<h3>Key Points:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Investing involves allocating resources with the expectation of generating income or
        profit.
    </li>
    <li>Investors purchase financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate
        to increase wealth over time.
    </li>
    <li>There are different investment strategies and asset classes, each with its own level of risk
        and potential return.
    </li>
    <li>Investors should consider their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when
        making investment decisions.
    </li>
    <li>Successful investing requires research, planning, and discipline to achieve long-term
        financial objectives.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Investments:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership shares in a corporation that entitle the shareholder to a
        portion of the company's assets and earnings. Stocks can be further categorized into common
        and preferred stocks. Common stocks give shareholders the right to vote at shareholder
        meetings and to receive dividends, while preferred stocks guarantee a fixed dividend but do
        not come with voting rights. Stocks can be bought and sold on stock exchanges, and their
        value can fluctuate based on market conditions and the financial health of the company.
    <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Debt securities issued by governments or corporations that pay
        interest over a fixed period and return the principal amount at maturity. Bonds can be
        categorized based on the issuer, such as government bonds, municipal bonds, or corporate
        bonds, and based on the creditworthiness of the issuer. Bonds can also be categorized based
        on their maturity, such as short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term bonds.
    <li><strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> Pooled investment vehicles that invest in a diversified
        portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds can be actively managed, where
        a fund manager makes investment decisions, or passively managed, where the fund tracks a
        specific index. Mutual funds can be categorized based on their investment objective, such as
        growth, income, or a mix of both.
    <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Physical property, such as land, buildings, or
        residential/commercial properties, purchased for investment purposes. Real estate can be a
        lucrative investment, as it can generate income through rental income and appreciate in
        value over time. Real estate can be owned directly or through real estate investment trusts
        (REITs), which are companies that own or finance real estate properties.
    <li><strong>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):</strong> Investment funds that are traded on stock
        exchanges and hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds. ETFs can be a
        cost-effective way to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, as they typically
        have lower expense ratios than actively managed mutual funds. ETFs can be bought and sold
        like individual stocks, and their value can fluctuate throughout the trading day.
    <li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Physical goods, such as oil, gold, or agricultural products,
        that can be traded on an exchange. Commodities can be a hedge against inflation and can
        provide diversification benefits to an investment portfolio. Commodities can be invested in
        directly or through futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell a commodity at a
        future date at a predetermined price.
    <li><strong>Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for
        security. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained popularity in recent
        years as an investment asset. However, investing in cryptocurrencies can be risky, as their
        value can be highly volatile and there is a lack of regulation in the market.
    <li><strong>Collectibles:</strong> Items that are collected for their potential to increase in
        value, such as art, coins, or stamps. Collectibles can be a passion investment, where the
        investor has a personal interest in the item, or a financial investment, where the investor
        is looking to profit from the appreciation in value.
</ol>

    <h3>Common Characteristics of Investment Scams:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of transparency:</strong> Investment scams often involve complex or
            confusing investment strategies that are difficult for the average investor to
            understand.
        </li>
        <li><strong>High-pressure sales tactics:</strong> Scam artists often use high-pressure sales
            tactics to convince investors to act quickly and without doing their due diligence.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Guaranteed returns:</strong> Investment scams often promise guaranteed returns
            or "no risk" investments, which is a red flag as no investment is completely risk-free.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lack of registration:</strong> Investment scams often involve unregistered
            securities or unlicensed salespeople.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Unsolicited offers:</strong> Investment scams often start with unsolicited
            offers made through phone calls, emails, or social media.
        </li>
        <li><strong>False credentials:</strong> Scam artists may claim to have impressive
            credentials or experience in order to build credibility and trust with investors.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lack of a paper trail:</strong> Investment scams often involve a lack of written
            documentation or a reluctance to provide written materials.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pressure to keep the investment secret:</strong> Scam artists may pressure
            investors to keep the investment secret.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Promises of exclusivity:</strong> Investment scams may promise investors
            exclusive access to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity or a secret investment strategy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Refusal to provide references:</strong> Scam artists may refuse to provide
            references or may provide fake references.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Investment Example</h3>
    <p> let’s say you have some extra money - maybe you received a bonus at work, or you’ve been
        saving a little bit each month. You decide to invest this money in the stock market.</p>
    <p>You do some research and decide to buy shares in a technology company, ABC Tech. You believe
        that ABC Tech has a strong business model and good growth prospects, so you purchase 100
        shares at 560.4 PHP each, for a total investment of 56,040 PHP.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Investment</th>
            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Number of Shares</td>
            <td>100 shares</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Initial Share Price</td>
            <td>560.4 PHP per share ($10)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Total Investment</td>
            <td>56,040 PHP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Final Share Price</td>
            <td>840.6 PHP per share ($15)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Current Investment Value</td>
            <td>84,060 PHP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Return on Investment</td>
            <td>50%</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>This is a simplified example and actual investing involves more factors like transaction fees,
    taxes, and potential losses. It’s also important to remember that investing in the stock market
    involves risk, and it’s possible to lose money. Therefore, it’s always a good idea to do
    thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making investment
    decisions. Remember, the value of investments can go up as well as down, and you may get back
    less than you invested.</p>
