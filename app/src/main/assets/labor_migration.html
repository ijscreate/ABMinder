    <h2>Labor Migration and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)</h2>
    <p>Labor migration and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) play a crucial role in the Philippines'
        economy and social fabric. Migration is not only a livelihood strategy for millions of
        Filipinos seeking better employment opportunities but also a significant contributor to
        poverty reduction and economic development.</p>

    <h3>History and Growth of Labor Migration</h3>
    <p>The Philippines has a long history of labor migration, with OFWs representing a subset of
        Overseas Filipinos who are temporary migrants. Over the last thirty years, overseas labor
        migration has become increasingly important, reducing unemployment and strengthening US
        dollar reserves. The government of Ferdinand Marcos recognized the opportunity presented by
        the demand for workers in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and other regions,
        leading to the establishment of the Labor Code of the Philippines in 1974 to facilitate
        organized international labor migration. Initially intended as a temporary measure to
        address economic challenges, labor migration has continued to grow significantly over the
        years. The flow of OFWs surged past 1 million annually beginning in 2006, with more than
        1,844,000 Filipinos working abroad in 2015 alone.</p>

    <h3>Global Distribution and Contributions of OFWs</h3>
    <p>Filipinos are present across the globe due to work opportunities, with the Middle East
        receiving the largest share of OFWs followed by Asia. The Philippines has integrated itself
        into the global economy through government-sponsored labor export programs that send more
        than 500,000 Filipinos abroad each year to work in various countries and territories. These
        workers engage in a wide range of occupations, from doctors and nurses to janitors and
        maids, contributing significantly to their host countries' economies.</p>

    <h3>Government Policies and Economic Impact</h3>
    <p>The Philippine government's efforts at economic growth and development are closely tied to
        labor migration as a means of addressing unemployment and generating foreign exchange
        reserves. While labor-exporting countries like the Philippines retain control over their
        migration policies, international labor migration is influenced by specific demands within
        immigrant-receiving societies. The changing structural conditions in destination countries
        significantly impact the procurement of migrant labor, shaping patterns of employment and
        occupational structures within global labor markets.</p>
