    <h3>LEADING</h3>
    <p><strong>Specific Learning Outcome:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know the Nature of Leading</li>
        <li>Understand the Leadership Theories</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What is Leadership?</h4>
    <p>Leadership can simply be defined as the ability to influence others. Leadership is the work
        that is done by the leader. Keith Devis said that leadership is the process of encouraging
        and helping others to work enthusiastically toward objectives. According to Koontz and
        Donnell, the act of leadership is the process of influencing people so that they will strive
        willingly and enthusiastically toward the achievement of the group goal. Ideally, people
        should be encouraged to develop not only a willingness to work but also a willingness to
        work with confidence and zeal. Confidence reflects the experience and technical expertise;
        zeal is earnestness, and intensity in the execution of work. A leader acts to help a group
        achieve objectives through the exploitation of its maximum capabilities. It is also defined
        as the capacity to influence a group towards the realization of a goal. Leaders are required
        to develop a future vision and to motivate the organizational members to achieve the
        visions. Leadership is both a process and a property.</p>
    <p><strong>Nature of leadership</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leadership derives from the power and is similar to, yet distinct from, management. In
            fact, “leadership” and “management” are different. There can be leaders of completely
            unorganized groups, but there can be managers only of organized groups. Thus it can be
            said that a manager is necessarily a leader but a leader may not be a manager.
        </li>
        <li>Leadership is essential for managing. The ability to lead effectively is one of the keys
            to being an effective manager because she/he has to combine resources and lead a group
            to achieve objectives.
        </li>
        <li>Leadership and motivation are closely interconnected. By understanding motivation, one
            can appreciate better what people want and why they act as they do. A leader can
            encourage or dampen workers’ motivation by creating a favorable or unfavorable working
            environment in the organization.
        </li>
        <li>The essence of leadership is followership. In other words, it is the willingness of
            people to follow a person that makes that person a leader. Moreover, people tend to
            follow those whom they see as providing a means of achieving their desires, needs and
            wants.
        </li>
        <li>Leadership involves an unequal distribution of power between leaders and group members.
            Group members are not powerless; they can shape group activities in some ways. Still,
            the leader will usually have more power than the group members.
        </li>
        <li>Leaders can influence the followers’ behavior in some ways. Leaders can influence
            workers either to do ill or well for the company. The leader must be able to empower and
            motivate the followers to the cause.
        </li>
        <li>The leader must co-exist with the subordinates or followers and must have a clear idea
            about their demands and ambitions. This creates loyalty and trust in subordinates for
            their leader.
        </li>
        <li>Leadership is to be concerned about values. Followers learn ethics and values from their
            leaders. Leaders are the real teachers of ethics, and they can reinforce ideas. Leaders
            need to make positive statements of ethics if they are not hypocritical.
        </li>
        <li>Leading is a very demanding job both physically and psychologically. The leader must
            have the strength, power, and ability to meet the bodily requirements; zeal, energy, and
            patience to meet the mental requirements for leading.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Styles of Leadership</h4>
    <p>Leadership style refers to a leader's behavior towards group members. The behavioral pattern
        which the leader reflects in his role as a leader is often described as the style of
        leadership. Leadership style is the result of the leader’s philosophy, personality, value
        system, and experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Leadership is a Process and a Property</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Leadership is a Process</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leadership is the ability of a superior to influence the behavior of a subordinate or
            group and persuade them to follow a particular course of action.
        </li>
        <li>It is the art of inspiring subordinates or followers to perform their duties willingly,
            competently, and enthusiastically.
        </li>
        <li>As a process, leadership involves the use of non-coercive influence to direct &
            coordinate the activities of the members of an organized group towards the achievement
            of group objectives.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Leadership is a Property</strong></p>
    <p>Leadership is the set of characteristics attributed to individuals who are perceived to be
        leaders. Thus leaders are people who can influence the behaviors of others without having to
        rely on force or people whom others accept as leaders. As a property, leadership is a set of
        qualities or characteristics attributed to those who are perceived to successfully employ
        such influence. Such qualities include; ability to inspire the other, ability to understand
        human behavior, the ability of verbal assertiveness, willingness to take the risk.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Managers develop policies and procedures. Leaders develop vision and strategy.</li>
        <li>Managers direct and control. Leaders motivate and inspire. Stated another way, Managers
            get people to do what needs to be done. Leaders get people to want to do what needs to
            be done (read that again if you need to; the distinction is subtle.)
        </li>
        <li>Managers explain “what we have to do.” Leaders explain “where we are going.”</li>
        <li>Managers give directions. Leaders ask questions.</li>
        <li>Managers are concerned with the here and now. Leaders are concerned with the
            long-view.
        </li>
        <li>Managers are bottom-line oriented. Leaders are big-picture oriented.</li>
        <li>Managers are concerned with projects. Leaders are concerned with people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, the classic distinction attributed to both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis:
        Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. Most of us find that
        our day-to-day work requires the skills and activities of both leadership and management at
        different times. So why do we bother to draw distinctions? The distinctions are important
        because while both roles are necessary, many of us tend to spend too much time trying to
        manage. Spending more time focused on leading would allow us to achieve greater results and
        feel greater satisfaction from our efforts.</p>
    <h4>What are leadership theory and leadership style?</h4>
    <p>Leadership theory studies the qualities of good leaders. Psychologists analyze and develop
        leadership theory, and researchers try to discover the common qualities or behavioral
        patterns of excellent leaders. Some of the leadership aspects they consider include:
        Personality traits, Actions, Environment, Situation, Decision-making process, How input is
        received, How relationships are maintained. Leadership style is the way a leader approaches
        managing team members. Leadership styles were formally developed as a result of studies on
        leadership theory, and each style includes distinct qualities. Common leadership styles
        include: Coach: Recognizes strengths and weaknesses, helps people set goals and provides a
        lot of feedback. Visionary: Manages through inspiration and confidence. Servant: Focuses on
        helping team members feel fulfilled. Autocratic or authoritarian: Makes decisions with
        little or no input from others. Laissez-faire or hands-off: Delegates tasks and provides
        little supervision. Democratic: Considers the opinions of others before making a decision.
        Pacesetter: Sets high standards and focuses on performance. Bureaucratic: Follows a strict
        hierarchy and expects team members to follow procedure.</p>

    <h4>Six main leadership theories</h4>
    <p>The primary leadership theories are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The great man theory</strong>
            <p>The great man theory of leadership states that excellent leaders are born, not
                developed. A popular concept in the 19th century, this theory states that leadership
                is an inherent quality. This type of leader often possesses the natural attributes
                of intelligence, courage, confidence, intuition and charm, among others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The trait theory</strong>
            <p>The trait theory of leadership states that certain natural qualities tend to create
                good leaders. Having certain qualities does not necessarily mean someone has strong
                leadership skills, however. Some leaders may be excellent listeners or
                communicators, but not every listener or communicator makes an excellent leader.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The behavioral theory</strong>
            <p>The behavioral theory of leadership focuses on how a person’s environment, not
                natural abilities, forms him or her into a leader. One of the key concepts of
                behavioral theory is conditioning. Conditioning states that a person will be more
                likely to act or lead in a certain style as a result of environmental responses to
                behavior.</p>
            <p>In the 1930s, Kurt Lewin developed a framework based on a leader's behavior. He
                argued that there are three types of leaders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autocratic leaders:</strong> Make decisions without consulting their
                    teams. This style of leadership is considered appropriate when decisions need to
                    be made quickly, when there's no need for input, and when team agreement isn't
                    necessary for a successful outcome.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Democratic leaders:</strong> Allow the team to provide input before
                    making a decision, although the degree of input can vary from leader to leader.
                    This style is important when team agreement matters, but it can be difficult to
                    manage when there are lots of different perspectives and ideas.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Laissez-faire leaders:</strong> Don't interfere; they allow people
                    within the team to make many of the decisions. This works well when the team is
                    highly capable, is motivated, and doesn't need close supervision. However, this
                    behavior can arise because the leader is lazy or distracted; and this is where
                    this style of leadership can fail.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The transactional theory or management theory</strong>
            <p>The transactional theory of leadership, also called the management theory, studies
                leadership as a system of rewards and penalties. It views effective leadership as
                results-focused and hierarchical. Transactional leaders prioritize order and
                structure over creativity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The transformational theory or relationship theory</strong>
            <p>The transformational theory of leadership, also called the relationship theory,
                studies effective leadership as the result of a positive relationship between
                leaders and team members. Transformational leaders motivate and inspire through
                their enthusiasm and passion. They are a model for their teams, and they hold
                themselves to the same standard they expect of others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The situational theory</strong>
            <p>The situational theory of leadership does not relate to a certain type of leader or
                claim that any one style is best. Instead, situational theory argues that the best
                kind of leader is one who is able to adapt her style based on the situation. They
                may respond to a situation by commanding, coaching, persuading, participating,
                delegating or however they think is necessary. Situational leaders are defined by
                their flexibility.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>What is Diversity in the Workplace?</h4>
    <p>For an organization looking to cultivate a more diverse and inclusive workplace, it is
        important to understand what constitutes workplace diversity. Workplace diversity refers to
        the variety of differences between individuals in an organization. Diversity not only
        includes how individuals identify themselves but also how others perceive them. Diversity
        within a workplace encompasses race, gender, ethnic groups, age, religion, sexual
        orientation, citizenship status, military service and mental and physical conditions, as
        well as other distinct differences between people.</p>

    <h4>Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace</h4>
    <p>Employees from diverse backgrounds imbue organizations with creative new ideas and
        perspectives informed by their cultural experiences. A diverse workplace will help
        organizations better understand target demographics and what moves them. A diverse workplace
        can better align an organization’s culture with the demographic make-up of America.
        Increased customer satisfaction by improving how employees interact with a more diverse
        clientele and public.</p>

    <h4>How to Manage Diversity in the Workplace</h4>
    <p>Managing diversity in the workplace presents a set of unique challenges for HR professionals.
        These challenges can be mitigated if an organization makes a concerted effort to encourage a
        more heterogeneous environment through promoting a culture of tolerance, open communication
        and creating conflict management strategies to address issues that may arise.</p>

    <h5>Tips for managing workplace diversity:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Communication:</strong> Ensure effective communication with employees
            by overcoming language and cultural barriers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Treat Each Employee as an Individual:</strong> Avoid making assumptions about
            employees from different backgrounds and judge successes and failures on individual
            merit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Encourage Employees to Work in Diverse Groups:</strong> Diverse work teams can
            help break down preconceived notions and cultural misunderstandings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Base Standards on Objective Criteria:</strong> Set one standard of rules for all
            groups of employees regardless of background.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Be Open-Minded:</strong> Recognize and encourage employees to recognize that
            one’s own experience, background, and culture are not the only ones with value to the
            organization.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Hiring Tips for a Diverse Workforce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorporate a diverse interview panel to ensure candidates are chosen solely based on
            suitability for the position.
        </li>
        <li>Managers should be trained on what can and cannot be asked in an interview to avoid
            bias.
        </li>
        <li>Get creative when recruiting by reaching out to professional groups that cater to
            underrepresented demographics.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Policies and Practices</h4>
    <p>Organizations that embrace diversity also need to ensure that there are policies and
        practices in place to protect employees’ rights and stay compliant with government
        regulations.</p>
    <p>It is essential for an organization to think about the impact that company policies and
        practices have on a diverse group of employees. Companies should create a way for employees
        to give feedback with surveys and suggestion boxes to gain a better understanding of how
        employees feel about diversity policies. Any feedback received, both positive and negative,
        is valuable. Companies need to be ready to adapt and change policies that may be interpreted
        as obstructions or not helpful for employees.</p>
    <p>In addition to the written policies, it is also essential to ensure that the non-official
        “rules” of an organization are thoroughly explained to all employees to communicate company
        values and culture to all workers effectively.</p>

    <h5>Documentation of Policies and Procedures</h5>
    <p>Properly documenting diversity policies is an effective means of communicating an
        organization’s stances on diversity. Once concrete plans are ready to be implemented,
        documents that outline each policy should be included in the employee handbook. Diversity
        policies should be reviewed with every new hire, and when updates to policies are made, they
        should be shared with current employees as well.</p>
    <p>Employee handbooks should cover diversity in the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code of conduct should outline the company’s policy toward diversity</li>
        <li>Non-discrimination policy lets employees know about diversity</li>
        <li>Compensation and benefits policy</li>
        <li>Employment conditions and termination</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Zero-Tolerance Policy</h5>
    <p>Having a diverse workplace means that off-color jokes about ethnicity, gender, sexual
        orientation or religion need to be met with zero-tolerance enforcement. Slurs, name-calling
        and bullying employees for any reason has no place in today’s workplace. Policies should be
        put in place to handle misconduct and communicate to employees that this type of behavior
        will not be tolerated.</p>
    <p>Organizations will also need to make sure employees feel safe reporting any instances of
        inappropriate behavior by co-workers by establishing a formal complaint policy, so employees
        know how to report misconduct to the proper authority within an organization.</p>

    <h5>Sensitivity Training</h5>
    <p>Employees need to be aware of how to coexist with a diverse range of people, as well as be
        cognizant of cultural sensitivity, to achieve harmony within a diverse workplace.
        Sensitivity training can help an organization manage diversity in the workplace by helping
        employees become more self-aware, which plays a vital role in helping employees understand
        their own cultural biases and prejudices.</p>
    <p>Benefits of sensitivities training:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Helps employees examine and adjust their perspectives about people from different
            backgrounds
        </li>
        <li>Employees can learn to better appreciate the views of others</li>
        <li>Shows employees what actions are offensive and why they are perceived as such</li>
        <li>Teaches employees how to calmly communicate that a co-worker has offended them and how
            to resolve the conflict properly
        </li>
        <li>Explains to employees how to apologize to a co-worker if they have indeed offended them
            unknowingly
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Stay Abreast of Diversity Laws</h5>
    <p>Managing diversity in the workplace means that businesses need to keep abreast of changing
        employer-related laws and trends, especially diversity related changes. Organizations should
        regularly review internal policies, especially those around harassment and equal
        opportunity, and make sure they reflect the most current laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>If an organization has an international or multi-state presence, it is necessary to track
        regional changes to laws and regulations as they vary from country to county and state to
        state.</p>
    <p>Diversity law resources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Society of Human Resources Management</li>
        <li>Bloomberg BNA (Bureau of National Affairs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Encouraging diversity is the way forward for organizations. In a global talent market,
        businesses that can successfully manage diversity in the workplace will have a definite
        competitive advantage over others in terms of differentiation, innovation, and employer
        branding.</p>
