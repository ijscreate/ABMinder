<section><h3>3.3.1 Markup</h3>

    <p>Markup is the additional amount added to the cost price of a product to cover overhead,
        operating expenses, and profit. It is expressed as a percentage increase in the cost price
        to determine the selling price.</p>

    <h4>Markup:</h4>

    <p>The additional amount added to the cost price to cover overhead, operating expenses, and
        profit.</p>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/mark_up_ate.jpg" alt="Mark Up Percentage"
         style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>The formula calculates markup by subtracting the cost price from the selling price, dividing
        the result by the cost price, and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.</p>

    <h4>Mark Up Percentage:</h4>

    <p>The percentage representing the markup relative to the cost price.</p>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/mark_up_ate.jpg" alt="Mark Up Percentage"
         style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>This formula calculates the mark up percentage by dividing the markup by the cost price and
        multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.</p>

    <h4>Why Markup Matters:</h4>

    <p>Markup is an important concept for pricing and profitability of a product. It can help a
        business to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Set the selling price:</strong> Markup can help determine the optimal selling
            price for a product that covers the cost and generates the desired profit.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the profit:</strong> Markup can help calculate the profit earned from
            selling a product by multiplying the markup percentage by the cost price.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Compare products:</strong> Markup can help compare the profitability of
            different products or categories by comparing their markup percentages.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Examples and Calculations:</h4>

    <p>Here are some examples of how to calculate and interpret markup and mark up percentage:</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A company buys a product for ₱50 and sells it for ₱75. The markup
        and mark up percentage are:</p>

    <div class="comment">
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Markup = Selling Price - Cost Price</p>

        <p>Markup = ₱75 - ₱50</p>

        <p>Markup = ₱25</p>

        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Mark Up Percentage = (Markup / Cost Price) x 100</p>

        <p>Mark Up Percentage = (₱25 / ₱50) x 100</p>

        <p>Mark Up Percentage = 50%</p>

        <p>This means that the company adds ₱25 to the cost price of the product and sells it for
            50%
            more than the cost price.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A company wants to sell a product for ₱100 and earn a 40% markup.
        The cost price of the product is:</p>

    <div class="comment">
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Mark Up Percentage = (Markup / Cost Price) x 100</p>

        <p>40 = (Markup / Cost Price) x 100</p>

        <p>Markup = 40 x Cost Price / 100</p>

        <p>Markup = 0.4 x Cost Price</p>

        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Markup = Selling Price - Cost Price</p>

        <p>0.4 x Cost Price = ₱100 - Cost Price</p>

        <p>1.4 x Cost Price = ₱100</p>

        <p>Cost Price = ₱100 / 1.4</p>

        <p>Cost Price = ₱71.43</p>

        <p>This means that the company needs to buy the product for ₱71.43 or less to achieve a 40%
            markup and sell it for ₱100.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3.3.2 Profit Margin</h3>

    <p>Profit margin is the percentage of profit derived from the selling price of a product. It
        indicates the
        profitability of a business and is crucial for financial analysis and decision-making.</p>

    <h4>Profit Margin:</h4>

    <p>The percentage of profit relative to the selling price.
    </p>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/profit_margin.jpg" alt="Profit Margin"
         style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>The formula calculates profit margin by dividing the profit by the selling price and


        multiplying by 100 to
        express it as a percentage.</p>

    <h4>Types of Profit Margin:</h4>

    <p>There are different types of profit margin that measure the profitability of a business
        at different levels. Some of the common types are:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> The percentage of profit after deducting the
            cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue. It measures the efficiency of production
            and pricing.
        </li>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/gross_margin.png" alt="gross margin"
        style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

        <li><strong>Operating Profit Margin:</strong> The percentage of profit after deducting
            the operating expenses (such as wages, rent, utilities, etc.) from the revenue. It
            measures the operational efficiency of a business.
        </li>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/operating_profit_margin.png" alt="operating profit margin"
             style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

        <li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> The percentage of profit after deducting all
            expenses (including taxes and interest) from the revenue. It measures the overall
            profitability of a business.
        </li>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/net_profit_margin.png" alt="net profit margin"
        style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

    </ul>

    <h4>Applications of Profit Margin:</h4>

    <p>Profit margin is a useful metric for evaluating the performance and profitability of a
        business. It can be used to:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Compare businesses:</strong> Profit margin can help compare the
            profitability of different businesses or industries, regardless of their size or
            revenue. A higher profit margin indicates a more profitable and efficient business.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Analyze trends:</strong> Profit margin can help analyze the changes in
            profitability over time or across different periods. An increasing profit margin
            indicates an improvement in profitability, while a decreasing profit margin
            indicates a decline in profitability.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Optimize pricing strategies:</strong> Profit margin can help determine the
            optimal pricing strategy for a product or service. A higher profit margin means a
            higher profit per unit sold, while a lower profit margin means a lower profit per
            unit sold. A business can adjust its pricing strategy to achieve its desired profit
            margin.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Examples and Calculations:</h4>

    <p>Here are some examples of how to calculate and interpret profit margin:</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A company sells a product for ₱100 and incurs a cost of ₱60
        to produce it. The profit is ₱40. The profit margin is:</p>
    <div class="comment">
        <p>Profit Margin = (Profit / Selling Price) * 100</p>

        <p>Profit Margin = (₱40 / ₱100) * 100</p>

        <p>Profit Margin = 40%</p>

        <p>This means that the company earns ₱40 of profit for every ₱100 of revenue.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A company has a revenue of ₱1,000,000, a COGS of ₱600,000, an
        operating expense of ₱200,000, and a net income of ₱150,000. The gross profit margin,
        operating profit margin, and net profit margin are:</p>

    <div class="comment">
        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) * 100</p>

        <p>Gross Profit Margin = ((1,000,000 - 600,000) / 1,000,000) * 100</p>

        <p>Gross Profit Margin = 40%</p>

        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Operating Profit Margin = (Operating Profit / Revenue) *
            100</p>

        <p>Operating Profit Margin = ((1,000,000 - 600,000 - 200,000) / 1,000,000) * 100</p>

        <p>Operating Profit Margin = 20%</p>

        <p style="font-family: Tahoma">Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100</p>

        <p>Net Profit Margin = (150,000 / 1,000,000) * 100</p>

        <p>Net Profit Margin = 15%</p>

        <p>This means that the company earns 40% of gross profit, 20% of operating profit,
            and 15% of net profit for every ₱1,000,000 of revenue.</p>
