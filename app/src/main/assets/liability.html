<h2>Liabilities</h2>
<p>Liabilities, in financial accounting, refer to financial obligations that a person or company
    owes to others, typically involving the transfer of economic benefits over time. They can range
    from simple debts like car payments to large loans for business operations. Liabilities are
    crucial in business finance, often used to fund operations and expansions. They are categorized
    into current liabilities, due within a year, and non-current liabilities, not expected to be
    settled within a year. Proper management of liabilities is essential for a company's financial
    health, impacting liquidity, capital structure, and overall performance</p>
<p>A liability is incurred to realize a transfer of economic benefits, with the recipient of
    economic benefits incurring the liability. For example, when a business buys goods on credit
    from its supplier, the supplier completes a sale to its customer and collects cash.</p>
<p>Liabilities can be settled through various means, including cash payment, distribution of other
    assets, rendering of services, substitution with another liability, or conversion of the
    liability into ownership interest of the lender in the borrower’s entity.</p>
