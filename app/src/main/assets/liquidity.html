        <h2>What is Liquidity?</h2>
        <p>Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset, or security, can be converted into
            ready cash without affecting its market price. Liquidity is characterized by a high
            level of trading activity. Assets that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid
            assets. Conversely, assets that take longer to sell are considered illiquid or
            non-liquid.</p>
        <p>Liquidity is essential for the smooth functioning of financial markets and is a key
            consideration for investors when making investment decisions.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Liquidity</h2>
            <h3>Market Liquidity</h3>
            <p>Market liquidity pertains to how easily assets can be bought and sold in a market at
                stable and transparent prices. In contrast to the illiquid market for rare books and
                refrigerators, stock markets typically exhibit higher market liquidity. A high trade
                volume not dominated by selling results in bid and ask prices being closely aligned.
                Tight bid-ask spreads indicate high liquidity, while widening spreads signify lower
                liquidity. Real estate markets generally have lower liquidity compared to stock
                markets, while the liquidity of other assets like derivatives, currencies, or
                commodities depends on factors such as market size and availability of trading
                platforms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Accounting Liquidity</h3>
            <p>Accounting liquidity gauges an individual's or company's ability to meet financial
                obligations using their liquid assets. It involves comparing liquid assets to
                current liabilities or debts due within a year.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Measuring Liquidity</h2>
        <p>Financial analysts assess a firm's capacity to fulfill short-term obligations using
            liquid assets. Ratios greater than one are usually preferred in these analyses.</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Current Ratio</h3>
            <p>The current ratio is a basic measure comparing current assets against current
                liabilities, indicating the firm's ability to cover short-term obligations.</p>

            <h3>Liquidity Example in the Philippines</h3>
            <p>In the Philippines, liquidity can be observed in various financial markets and
                transactions. Let's consider an example illustrating liquidity in the Philippine
                stock market:</p>
            <h4>Trading Stocks on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)</h4>
            <p>The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) serves as the primary platform for buying and
                selling stocks of publicly listed companies in the Philippines. Liquidity in the
                stock market refers to the ease and efficiency with which stocks can be bought or
                sold without significantly impacting their market price.</p>
            <p>Suppose an investor wants to purchase shares of a company listed on the PSE. They can
                place an order through their brokerage account, specifying the quantity of shares
                they wish to buy and the price they are willing to pay. Similarly, if an investor
                wants to sell their shares, they can place a sell order with their broker.</p>
            <p>Liquidity in the PSE is evident in the following ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>High Trade Volume: The PSE experiences significant trading activity, with
                    numerous buy and sell orders executed throughout the trading day. This high
                    volume of transactions indicates liquidity, as there are ample opportunities for
                    investors to buy or sell stocks at prevailing market prices.
                </li>
                <li>Tight Bid-Ask Spreads: Liquidity is also reflected in the bid-ask spread, which
                    is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid
                    price) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask price). In a
                    liquid market, bid-ask spreads tend to be narrow, indicating that buyers and
                    sellers are closely aligned in their pricing expectations.
                </li>
                <li>Availability of Market Participants: The PSE attracts a diverse range of market
                    participants, including individual investors, institutional investors, traders,
                    and market makers. This broad participation contributes to liquidity by
                    increasing the likelihood of finding counterparties for trade orders.
                </li>
                <li>Market Depth: Liquidity is further enhanced by the depth of the market, which
                    refers to the volume of buy and sell orders at various price levels. A deep
                    market indicates robust liquidity, as there are sufficient orders to accommodate
                    large trades without significantly impacting prices.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, the active trading environment, narrow bid-ask spreads, diverse participant
                base, and market depth demonstrate liquidity in the Philippine stock market. This
                liquidity facilitates efficient price discovery, supports investor confidence, and
                enables seamless execution of buy and sell orders, contributing to the smooth
                functioning of the country's capital markets.</p>

            <h3>Importance of Liquidity</h3>
            <p>Liquidity is essential for several reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Trading and Market Efficiency:</strong> High liquidity facilitates
                    efficient trading and price discovery in financial markets. It allows investors
                    to enter and exit positions quickly, reducing market volatility and enhancing
                    market efficiency.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Liquidity plays a vital role in managing
                    investment risk. It enables investors to adjust their portfolios promptly in
                    response to changing market conditions or unexpected events.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Access to Cash:</strong> Adequate liquidity ensures that individuals and
                    businesses have access to cash when needed, preventing financial distress during
                    times of financial stress.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Understanding liquidity is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. It
                helps in making informed decisions about investments, managing risk, and ensuring
                the smooth functioning of financial markets.</p>
