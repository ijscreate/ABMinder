    <h2>Amortization</h2>
    <p>Amortization is the process of spreading out a loan into a series of fixed payments over
        time. These payments are designed to pay off the loan balance gradually, with each payment
        covering both the interest and a portion of the principal amount.</p>
    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The original amount of the loan.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest:</strong> The cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the
            principal.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> The fixed amount paid each period, typically monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Amortization Schedule:</strong> A table that shows the breakdown of each
            payment, including the portion that goes towards interest and the portion that goes
            towards reducing the principal.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With each payment, the portion that goes towards interest decreases while the portion that
        goes towards reducing the principal increases. Over time, the loan balance decreases until
        it is fully paid off.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of Amortization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides a clear repayment schedule for borrowers.</li>
        <li>Ensures that the loan is paid off by a specified date.</li>
        <li>Helps borrowers build equity in an asset, such as a home.</li>
        <li>Allows borrowers to budget for fixed monthly payments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of Loans That Use Amortization</h3>
    <p>Amortization is a loan repayment method that involves equal payments of both the principal
        and interest over a set period. This method is commonly used for different types of loans,
        including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mortgages: </strong>Mortgages are loans taken out to purchase real estate, such
            as a home or commercial property. The borrower typically repays the loan over a period
            of 15, 20, or 30 years, with equal monthly payments that include both principal and
            interest.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Car loans: </strong>Car loans are taken out to purchase a vehicle. The borrower
            typically repays the loan over a period of 3 to 5 years, with equal monthly payments
            that include both principal and interest.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Personal loans: </strong>Personal loans are taken out for various personal
            reasons, such as consolidating debt, financing a wedding, or funding a home renovation.
            These loans can be secured or unsecured and are typically repaid over a period of 1 to 5
            years, with equal monthly payments that include both principal and interest.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business loans: </strong>Business loans are taken out to finance the operations
            or expansion of a business. These loans can be secured or unsecured and are typically
            repaid over a period of 1 to 10 years, with equal monthly or quarterly payments that
            include both principal and interest.
        </li>
    </ul>
