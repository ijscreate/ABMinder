    <h2>Loan</h2>
    <p>A loan is a financial arrangement where a borrower obtains a specific amount of money from a
        lender, often a bank or credit union, with the agreement to repay the borrowed sum along
        with interest within a predetermined period. Loans serve various purposes, such as funding
        significant purchases, launching or expanding a business, or consolidating debts.</p>

    <h3>Types of Loans:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Personal loans:</strong> These are unsecured loans utilized for personal
            expenses like debt consolidation, home renovations, or medical bills.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Auto loans:</strong> Secured loans designed for financing the purchase of a
            vehicle.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mortgages:</strong> Long-term loans used for buying a home.</li>
        <li><strong>Student loans:</strong> Loans intended to cover educational costs such as
            tuition, fees, and accommodation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business loans:</strong> Loans aimed at financing business needs like inventory,
            equipment, or operational expenses.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>When an individual takes out a loan, they commit to repaying the principal amount borrowed,
        in addition to any interest and charges, over the loan's duration. The loan terms,
        encompassing the interest rate, repayment schedule, and associated fees, are typically
        detailed in a loan agreement.</p>

    <p>It's crucial for borrowers to thoroughly assess the terms of a loan before agreeing to it, as
        accumulating excessive debt can pose financial risks. Borrowers should also devise a
        repayment strategy and strive to settle the loan promptly to reduce the total interest paid
        throughout the loan's lifespan.</p>

    <div class="class">
        <h3>5 C's of Credit</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Character:</strong> The willingness of the borrower to repay the loan.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> A customer's ability to generate cash flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Security pledged for payment of the loan.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital:</strong> A customer's financial resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Current economic or business conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The institution's primary consideration in approving loan applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Benefits of Taking Out a Loan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access to Funds:</strong> Loans provide access to funds that may not be
                readily available, allowing borrowers to finance major purchases or expenses that
                they may not be able to pay for out of pocket.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Loans can be used for a variety of purposes, such as
                financing a business, consolidating debt, or making home improvements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ability to Build Credit:</strong> Taking out a loan and making timely
                payments can help borrowers build a positive credit history, which can improve their
                credit score and make it easier to obtain credit in the future.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Potential Tax Benefits:</strong> In some cases, the interest paid on a loan
                may be tax deductible, which can help borrowers save money on their taxes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Loans can provide borrowers with the ability to leverage
                their assets or income to finance larger purchases or investments, which can
                potentially lead to greater returns.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to note that while loans can provide access to funds and other benefits,
            they also come with risks and responsibilities. Borrowers should carefully consider the
            terms of a loan and make sure they have a plan in place to repay the loan before taking
            one out.</p>

        <h3>Example scenario:</h3>
        <p>Imagine a scenario where an individual, let’s call them Juan, is looking to purchase a
            new car. The car costs PHP 500,000, but Juan doesn’t have the funds readily available.
            So, he decides to take out a loan.</p>
        <p>Juan approaches a lender, who offers him a loan of PHP 500,000. This amount, known as the
            principal, is to be repaid over a period of 5 years. The lender also sets a fixed
            interest rate of 10% per annum for the loan.</p>
        <p>The interest rate is usually quoted on an annual basis, known as the Annual Percentage
            Rate (APR). However, since loan repayments are typically made on a monthly basis, we
            need to convert this annual interest rate into a monthly interest rate. In this case,
            the monthly interest rate (r) would be 0.10 (annual interest rate) divided by 12 (months
            in a year), which equals approximately 0.00833333333333.</p>
        <p>The monthly repayment amount, often referred to as the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI),
            can be calculated using the following formula:</p>

        <p>Solving this equation gives us a monthly payment of approximately PHP 10,575.23.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the 5-year (or 60-month) loan term, Juan will make 60 payments of PHP
            10,575.23 each. This amounts to a total repayment of PHP 634,513.80. Of this total
            amount, PHP 134,513.80 represents the interest charges accrued over the loan term.</p>
        <p>This example illustrates the mechanics of a typical loan. However, it’s important to note
            that actual loan terms may vary based on a variety of factors, including the borrower’s
            creditworthiness, the lender’s policies, and prevailing market conditions.</p>
