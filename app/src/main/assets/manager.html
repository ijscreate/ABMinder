<h2>What Is a Manager?</h2>
<p>A Manager is a person who manages or is in charge of something. Managers can control departments
    in companies or guide the people who work for them. Managers must often make decisions about
    things. A manager is an expert in his or her field and is a support system for employees.
    Managers work within a business and work together as a team to achieve company goals. A manager
    is not a person who does a million things at once while employees take a back seat. It is vital
    for managers to delegate responsibilities to employees and assist them if they need help.</p>
<p>As a manager, you have to put on many hats and be flexible. Imagine you are blindfolded and
    walking through a forest. Could you imagine how many times you would hit a tree or trip because
    you have no direction? It is your job to help employees navigate. If they trip, it is the
    manager's job to help them stand up and motivate them to achieve their goals. A manager who
    watches his or her employee trip and fail without helping them is not the kind of manager you
    want to be. Employees will feed off their manager's energy, and that positive energy will help
    create a successful work environment.</p>
<p>Managers just don't go out and haphazardly perform their responsibilities. Good managers discover
    how to master five basic functions: planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and
    controlling.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Planning:</strong> This step involves mapping out exactly how to achieve a
        particular goal. Say, for example, that the organization's goal is to improve company sales.
        The manager first needs to decide which steps are necessary to accomplish that goal. These
        steps may include increasing advertising, inventory, and sales staff. These necessary steps
        are developed into a plan. When the plan is in place, the manager can follow it to
        accomplish the goal of improving company sales.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Organizing:</strong> After a plan is in place, a manager needs to organize her team
        and materials according to her plan. Assigning work and granting authority are two important
        elements of organizing.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Staffing:</strong> After a manager discerns his area's needs, he may decide to beef
        up his staffing by recruiting, selecting, training, and developing employees. A manager in a
        large organization often works with the company's human resources department to accomplish
        this goal.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Leading:</strong> A manager needs to do more than just plan, organize, and staff her
        team to achieve a goal. She must also lead. Leading involves motivating, communicating,
        guiding, and encouraging. It requires the manager to coach, assist, and problem solve with
        employees.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Controlling:</strong> After the other elements are in place, a manager's job is not
        finished. He needs to continuously check results against goals and take any corrective
        actions necessary to make sure that his area's plans remain on track.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>All managers at all levels of every organization perform these functions, but the amount of time
    a manager spends on each one depends on both the level of management and the specific
    organization.</p>
<p><strong>Roles Performed by Managers</strong></p>
<p>A manager wears many hats. Not only is a manager a team leader, but he or she is also a planner,
    organizer, cheerleader, coach, problem solver, and decision-maker — all rolled into one. And
    these are just a few of a manager's roles.</p>
<p>In addition, managers' schedules are usually jam-packed. Whether they're busy with employee
    meetings, unexpected problems, or strategy sessions, managers often find little spare time on
    their calendars. (And that doesn't even include responding to email!)</p>
<p>In his classic book, <em>The Nature of Managerial Work</em>, Henry Mintzberg describes a set of
    ten roles that a manager fills.</p>
<p>These roles fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> This role involves human interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Informational:</strong> This role involves the sharing and analyzing of information.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Decisional:</strong> This role involves decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone can be a manager. Certain skills, or abilities to translate knowledge into action
    that results in desired performance, are required to help other employees become more
    productive. These skills fall under the following categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Technical:</strong> This skill requires the ability to use a special proficiency or
        expertise to perform particular tasks. Accountants, engineers, market researchers, and
        computer scientists, as examples, possess technical skills. Managers acquire these skills
        initially through formal education and then further develop them through training and job
        experience. Technical skills are most important at lower levels of management.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Human:</strong> This skill demonstrates the ability to work well in cooperation with
        others. Human skills emerge in the workplace as a spirit of trust, enthusiasm, and genuine
        involvement in interpersonal relationships. A manager with good human skills has a high
        degree of self-awareness and a capacity to understand or empathize with the feelings of
        others. Some managers are naturally born with great human skills, while others improve their
        skills through classes or experience. No matter how human skills are acquired, they're
        critical for all managers because of the highly interpersonal nature of managerial work.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conceptual:</strong> This skill calls for the ability to think analytically.
        Analytical skills enable managers to break down problems into smaller parts, to see the
        relations among the parts, and to recognize the implications of any one problem for others.
        As managers assume ever higher responsibilities in organizations, they must deal with more
        ambiguous problems that have long-term consequences. Again, managers may acquire these
        skills initially through formal education and then further develop them by training and job
        experience. The higher the management level, the more important conceptual skills become.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Although all three categories contain skills essential for managers, their relative importance
    tends to vary by the level of managerial responsibility. Business and management educators are
    increasingly interested in helping people acquire technical, human, and conceptual skills, and
    develop specific competencies, or specialized skills that contribute to high performance in a
    management job.</p>
<p>Following are some of the skills and personal characteristics that the American Assembly of
    Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) is urging business schools to help their students
    develop:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Leadership — ability to influence others to perform tasks</li>
    <li>Self-objectivity — ability to evaluate yourself realistically</li>
    <li>Analytic thinking — ability to interpret and explain patterns in information</li>
    <li>Behavioral flexibility — ability to modify personal behavior to react objectively rather
        than subjectively to accomplish organizational goals
    </li>
    <li>Oral communication — ability to express ideas clearly in words</li>
    <li>Written communication — ability to express ideas clearly in writing</li>
    <li>Personal impact — ability to create a good impression and instill confidence</li>
    <li>Resistance to stress — ability to perform under stressful conditions</li>
    <li>Tolerance for uncertainty — ability to perform in ambiguous situations</li>
</ul>
