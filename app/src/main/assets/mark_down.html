    <h3>What is Markdown?</h3>

    <p>Markdown is a business math term that refers to a reduction of the original retail sales
        price in order to increase sales. In other words, it is a process where the price list is
        permanently changed to a reduced price. Salespersons usually offer commodities at a reduced
        price so that they can stimulate a commodity's demand.</p>

    <p>The markdown amount can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
    <p><strong>Markdown Amount = Original Price - Sale Price</strong></p>
    <p>The markdown percentage can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
    <p><strong>Markdown Percentage = (Markdown Amount / Original Price) * 100%</strong></p>
    <p>These formulas help in determining the extent of reduction in price and the percentage of
        markdown applied.</p>

    <p style="font-family: verdana">How does Markdown Work?</p>

    <p>When it comes to the security market, there are two types of prices; bid prices and ask
        prices. Bid prices, in this case, refers to the prices that buyers are offering on
        securities, while ask prices are prices that the person selling the securities is offering.
        To get a bid-ask-price, you need to find the difference between the highest and the lowest
        bidding prices. Note that it is the difference between the dealer's price charges to a
        retail customer in exchange for security and the inside market price that is referred to as
        markdown. Markdown in when the difference in price is negative while markup is when the
        difference in price is positive.</p>

    <h3>What is Discount?</h3>

    <p>Discount is a reduction in the price of a product for a specific reason, such as a promotion,
        a loyalty program, a bulk purchase, or a special occasion. Discount is a temporary price
        change that is offered to certain customers or for a limited time. Discount is also known as
        a concession or a rebate.</p>
    <h4>What is the Difference Between Markdown and Discount?</h4>
    <p>The main difference between markdown and discount is that markdown is a permanent price
        change that affects the profitability and inventory value of the product, while discount is
        a temporary price change that does not affect the profitability and inventory value of the
        product.</p>
    <p>Markdown is a decision made by the retailer to lower the price of a product that is not
        selling well or is outdated. Markdown is a loss for the retailer, as it reduces the margin
        and the revenue of the product. Markdown also affects the accounting and reporting of the
        retailer, as it lowers the value of the inventory and the cost of goods sold.</p>
    <p>Discount is a strategy used by the retailer to attract customers, increase sales, and compete
        with other retailers. Discount is a benefit for the customer, as it lowers the price and
        increases the value of the product. Discount does not affect the accounting and reporting of
        the retailer, as it does not change the value of the inventory and the cost of goods
        sold.</p>
    <p>Another difference between markdown and discount is that markdown is applied to the product
        itself, while discount is applied to the transaction or the customer. Markdown is visible to
        all customers, as it is shown on the price tag or the shelf. Discount is not visible to all
        customers, as it is only given at the checkout or with a coupon.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Markdown and Discount</h3>

    <p>Suppose a broker desires to increase the volume of his or her stock sales in a stock market.
        To achieve this, the broker will decide to sell the stocks at a markdown price (reduced
        price). In other words, the decision of a broker to sell stocks to investors at a lower
        price than the current selling price in the stock market is referred to as the markdown. For
        instance, let's say broker X sells shares of ABC stock to buyers at a rate of ₱20 per share.
        In the broker market, the original price of these shares was ₱40 per share. In this case,
        the broker will markdown on the shares when he sales will be; ₱20 - ₱40 = - ₱20.</p>

    <p>Another example of markdown is when a retailer decides to lower the price of a product that
        is not selling well or is out of season. For example, a clothing store may markdown the
        price of winter jackets in spring to clear the inventory and make room for new arrivals. The
        markdown percentage can be calculated by dividing the difference between the original price
        and the sale price by the original price. For example, if a jacket was originally priced at
        ₱100 and is now on sale for ₱70, the markdown percentage is (₱100 - ₱70) / ₱100 = 0.3 or
        30%.</p>

    <p>A retailer has a winter coat that was originally priced at ₱200. However, after the winter
        season, the retailer decides to markdown the coat by 50% to clear the inventory. The
        markdown percentage is calculated by finding 50% of the original price, which is ₱100. So,
        the markdown amount is ₱100. To get the markdown price, we subtract the markdown amount from
        the original price: ₱200 - ₱100 = ₱100. This means the coat is now priced at ₱100 after the
        markdown.</p>

    <p>A retailer has a loyalty program that offers 5% off on every purchase for members. A customer
        buys a shirt that was originally priced at ₱40. To calculate the discount amount, we find 5%
        of ₱40, which is ₱2. So, the discount amount is ₱2. To get the discount price, we subtract
        the discount amount from the original price: ₱40 - ₱2 = ₱38. This means the customer pays
        ₱38 for the shirt after the discount.</p>

    <p>A retailer has a buy one get one free promotion on selected items. A customer buys two pairs
        of socks that were originally priced at ₱10 each. Since it's a buy one get one free offer,
        the customer pays for only one pair of socks. So, the discount amount is ₱10, which is the
        price of one pair of socks. The customer effectively gets one pair for free, so the total
        price paid is ₱10. This means the customer pays ₱10 for two pairs of socks after the
        discount.</p>

    <p>A retailer has a clearance sale that offers an additional 20% off on already marked down
        items. A customer buys a dress that was originally priced at ₱100, but was marked down by
        40% to ₱60. First, we calculate the markdown amount by finding 40% of ₱100, which is ₱40.
        So, the dress is marked down by ₱40. Then, with the additional 20% off, we find 20% of ₱60,
        which is ₱12. So, the customer receives an additional discount of ₱12. The final discount
        price is ₱60 - ₱12 = ₱48. This means the customer pays ₱48 for the dress after both markdown
        and additional discount.</p>

    <h3>Types of Markdown</h3>

    <p>There are two main types of markdown that businesses use to increase sales and customer
        satisfaction:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A sale/event:</strong> This type of markdown happens when you place an offer on
            your sale. For instance, you can have an offer like say Buy 2 Get 2 free, which
            translates to 50% off. This 50% off is meant to lure customers to buy the commodity,
            hence increasing your business cash flow.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Permanent price Change:</strong> This is where the price lists of commodities
            are permanently changed to a lower price. For instance, let's assume that you have
            different styles of shoe in 4 colors and selling them at $100 each. After a period of
            two months, you have managed to sell two of the colors including a few of the third
            color. However, when it comes to the fourth color, none has been sold. Now, you find
            yourself in a situation where the customers are declining to buy the fourth color of
            shoes at $100. You are then forced to lower the price so that you can attract the
            customers to purchase them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why is Markdown Important?</h3>

    <p>Markdown helps to stimulate the trading activities among customers with believing that the
        numerous commissions will lead to higher sales which will, in turn, offset the loss incurred
        in the negative spread. Markdown also helps to clear excess or unwanted inventory and
        generate cash flow for the business. Markdown can also increase customer loyalty and
        satisfaction by offering them attractive deals and discounts.</p>
