    <h3>What is Mark On Pricing?</h3>

    <p>Mark on is a term used in business mathematics to describe the additional percentage added to
        the cost price of a product to determine the selling price. It is also known as the profit
        margin or the mark-up percentage.</p>
    <p>The cost price of a product is the amount of money that a business pays to produce or buy the
        product. The selling price of a product is the amount of money that a business charges to
        sell the product to customers. The difference between the selling price and the cost price
        is the profit that the business makes from selling the product.</p>
    <p>Mark on is calculated by dividing the difference between the selling price and the cost price
        by the cost price and multiplying by 100%. For example, if a product costs ₱50 and is sold
        for ₱65, the mark on is (₱65 - ₱50) / ₱50 x 100% = 30%.</p>
    <p>The formula for calculating the mark on is:</p>
    <p><strong>Mark On = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100%</strong></p>
    <h3>Why is Mark On Important?</h3>
    <p>Mark on is important for businesses to set competitive prices and maximize profits.
        Businesses need to consider various factors when deciding how much mark on to apply to their
        products, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The demand for the product</li>
        <li>The competition in the market</li>
        <li>The quality and value of the product</li>
        <li>The cost of production and distribution</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Solve Problems Involving Mark On</h3>
    <p>To solve problems involving mark on, you need to identify the given information and the
        unknown variable, and then use the formula to find the answer. Here are some examples of how
        to solve problems involving mark on:</p>
    <h4>Example 1:</h4>
    <p>A business buys a laptop for ₱20,000 and sells it for ₱25,000. What is the mark on of the
        laptop?</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <pre>Given:
        Cost Price = ₱20,000
        Selling Price = ₱25,000</pre>
    <p>Using the formula:</p>
    <p>Mark On = (₱25,000 - ₱20,000) / ₱20,000 * 100%</p>
    <p>Mark On = ₱5,000 / ₱20,000 * 100%</p>
    <p>Mark On = 0.25 * 100%</p>
    <p>Mark On = 25%</p>
    <p>Therefore, the mark on of the laptop is 25%.</p>
    <h4>Example 2:</h4>
    <p>A business sells a pair of shoes for ₱1,200 and makes a profit of 20%. What is the cost price
        of the pair of shoes?</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <pre>Given:
        Selling Price = ₱1,200
        Mark On = 20% </pre>
    <p>Using the formula:</p>
    <p>20% = (₱1,200 - Cost Price) / Cost Price * 100%</p>
    <p>Solving for Cost Price:</p>
    <p>Cost Price = ₱1,200 / 1.2</p>
    <p>Cost Price = ₱1,000</p>
    <p>Therefore, the cost price of the pair of shoes is ₱1,000.</p>
