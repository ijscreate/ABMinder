    <h2>Economic Equilibrium</h2>
</header>
<div class="article-section">
    <p>Economic equilibrium is a state where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced
        and in the absence of external influences, there is no tendency for change in either
        direction. In a market with economic equilibrium, there is no shortage or surplus of goods
        or services, and prices tend to remain stable.</p>
    <p>In a free market economy, prices are determined by the forces of supply and demand. When the
        supply of a good or service matches the demand for it, an economic equilibrium is said to be
        achieved. At this point, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and the market
        clears.</p>
    <p>Economic equilibrium can be illustrated graphically using supply and demand curves. The point
        where these curves intersect represents the equilibrium price and quantity. Changes in
        supply or demand can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to shifts in the market and
        adjustments in prices until a new equilibrium is reached.</p>
    <p>Factors such as government interventions, changes in consumer preferences, technological
        advancements, and shifts in global markets can also impact economic equilibrium. For
        example, government regulations or taxes can affect production costs and alter the
        equilibrium price. Similarly, innovations or changes in consumer tastes can create new
        demand patterns, shifting the equilibrium point.</p>
    <div>
        <p>An example scenario of economic equilibrium could be in the market for a particular good,
            let's say smartphones.</p>

        <p>At a certain price level, let's say ₱25,000, there is an equilibrium where the quantity
            of smartphones supplied by manufacturers is equal to the quantity demanded by consumers.
            This means that at this price, all the smartphones that manufacturers are willing to
            produce can be sold to consumers who are willing to buy them.</p>

        <p>If the price is set too high, above ₱25,000, then there will be a surplus of smartphones
            because consumers are not willing to buy as many at that higher price. This surplus will
            put pressure on manufacturers to lower prices to sell off excess inventory, eventually
            leading back to the equilibrium price.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if the price is set too low, below ₱25,000, then there will be a
            shortage of smartphones because consumers are willing to buy more at that lower price
            than manufacturers are willing to produce. This shortage will drive prices up as
            manufacturers see an opportunity to make more profit, also moving back towards the
            equilibrium price of ₱25,000.</p>

        <p>In this scenario, economic equilibrium is achieved when the forces of supply and demand
            balance out, leading to a stable price where quantity supplied equals quantity
            demanded.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Economic equilibrium is a dynamic concept in economics where market forces
        interact to establish stable prices and quantities of goods and services. It is essential
        for understanding how markets function and how they respond to changes in the economic
        environment.</p>
