    <h2>Market Structure</h2>
    <p>Market structure refers to how a market is organized, based on the number of firms in the
        industry, the nature of the product, and the degree of competition. The four main types of
        market structure include perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and
        monopoly.</p>

    <h3>Perfect Competition</h3>
    <p>In perfect competition, there are many small firms producing identical products, and no
        single firm has control over the market price. This type of market structure is
        characterized by free entry and exit of firms, and prices are determined solely by supply
        and demand forces.</p>

    <h3>Monopolistic Competition</h3>
    <p>Monopolistic competition is similar to perfect competition but with slight product
        differentiation. Each firm produces a slightly different product, leading to a
        downward-sloping demand curve for each firm. Firms have some control over their prices but
        face competition from other firms producing similar products.</p>

    <h3>Oligopoly</h3>
    <p>Oligopoly exists when a few large firms dominate the market, producing either identical or
        differentiated products. These firms have significant market power and can influence prices.
        Oligopolistic markets are characterized by strategic interdependence among firms, with
        actions of one firm affecting the others.</p>

    <h3>Monopoly</h3>
    <p>In a monopoly market, there is a single seller controlling the entire market, with no close
        substitutes for the product. Monopolies have significant market power, allowing them to set
        prices higher than in competitive markets. Entry into a monopoly market is restricted,
        either due to high barriers or government regulation.</p>

    <p>Understanding market structure is crucial for businesses, policymakers, and economists. It
        affects pricing decisions, production strategies, and market behavior. By analyzing market
        structure, firms can identify opportunities for growth and potential threats from
        competitors. Policymakers use market structure analysis to regulate industries and promote
        competition, ensuring consumer welfare.</p>
