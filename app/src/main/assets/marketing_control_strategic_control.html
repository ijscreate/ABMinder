<h2>Marketing Control and Strategic Control in Marketing Management</h2>
<p>Marketing control involves evaluating the results of marketing strategies and plans and taking
    corrective action to ensure that objectives are attained. Operating control focuses on checking
    ongoing performance against the annual plan and taking corrective action when necessary. Its
    purpose is to ensure that the company achieves the sales, profits, and other goals set out in
    its annual plan.</p>

<h2>Strategic Control</h2>
<p>Strategic control involves assessing whether the company's basic strategies align well with its
    opportunities. A key tool for strategic control is a marketing audit, which is a comprehensive,
    systematic, independent, and periodic examination of a company's environment, objectives,
    strategies, and activities to identify problem areas and opportunities.</p>

<h2>Measuring and Managing Return on Marketing Investment</h2>
<p>Marketing managers must ensure that their marketing investments are yielding positive returns.
    Many companies now view marketing as an investment rather than an expense, developing better
    measures of return on marketing investment.</p>

<p>Marketing ROI is calculated as the net return from a marketing investment divided by the costs of
    the marketing effort. Companies can assess return on marketing through standard measures like
    brand awareness, sales, or market share.</p>

<p>Some companies are consolidating these measures into marketing dashboards, providing a useful set
    of marketing performance measures in a single display.</p>

<p>Marketers are increasingly using customer-centered measures of marketing impact, such as customer
    acquisition, retention, and customer lifetime value, to gauge the effectiveness of their
    marketing efforts.</p>

<p>By implementing marketing control and strategic control, companies can evaluate their marketing
    performance, make necessary adjustments, and ensure that their marketing strategies align with
    their objectives and opportunities. Additionally, measuring return on marketing investment
    allows companies to assess the effectiveness of their marketing activities and make informed
    decisions to optimize their marketing efforts.</p>
