        <h3>Nominal Level:</h3>
        <p>At this level, data can only be categorized into distinct groups without any inherent

        <p>Examples of nominal scales include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>City of birth</li>
            <li>Gender</li>

        <h3>Ordinal Level:</h3>
        <p>Data can be categorized and ranked, but we cannot infer the exact intervals between
            rankings.</p>
        <p>For instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ranking the top 5 Olympic medalists (though we don’t know the exact gap between
                their wins)
            </li>
            <li>Language ability (e.g., beginner, intermediate, fluent)</li>
            <li>Likert-type questions (e.g., very dissatisfied to very satisfied)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h3>Interval Level:</h3>
        <p>At this level, we can categorize, rank, and infer equal intervals between neighboring
            data points.</p>
        <p>However, there is no true zero point. Zero degrees does not signify an absolute absence
            of temperature; it’s arbitrary.</p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Test scores (e.g., IQ or exams)</li>
            <li>Personality inventories</li>

        <h3>Ratio Level:</h3>
        <p>The most precise level, where we can categorize, rank, infer equal intervals, and have a

        <p>A true zero means an absolute lack of the variable being measured.</p>
        <p>Examples of ratio scales:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Height (in centimeters or inches)</li>

<p><strong>Understanding Levels of Measurement in a Survey Analysis</strong>
</p>

<p>
    You are a market researcher working for a consumer goods company. Your team is tasked with
    conducting a survey to gather data on consumer preferences for a new product line. <br>
    <br>
    To design an effective survey, you need to understand the different levels of measurement and
    choose appropriate question types based on the nature of the data. <br>
    <br>
    Example scenario:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Nominal Level:</strong> <br>
        You include a question in the survey asking respondents to select their favorite color from
        a list of options. The colors (e.g., red, blue, green) represent distinct categories without
        any inherent order. This data is at the nominal level.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ordinal Level:</strong> <br>
        Another question in the survey asks respondents to rate their satisfaction with the
        company's customer service on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being "very dissatisfied" and 5
        being "very satisfied." While the responses are ranked, the exact intervals between the
        ratings are not uniform. This data is at the ordinal level.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interval Level:</strong> <br>
        You include a question asking respondents to rate their likelihood of recommending the
        company's products to others on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents "not likely at all"
        and 10 represents "extremely likely." The intervals between the ratings are equal, but there
        is no true zero point on the scale. This data is at the interval level.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ratio Level:</strong> <br>
        Finally, you ask respondents to provide their annual household income in dollars. This data
        is at the ratio level because it has a true zero point (absolute absence of income), and
        equal intervals between values allow for meaningful comparisons and mathematical operations.
    </li>
</ol>
