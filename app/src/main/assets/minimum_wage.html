    <h2>Renting a Property Overview</h2>

    <h3>Flexibility:</h3>
    <p>Renting provides flexibility in terms of location, allowing individuals to easily move to
        different areas without the commitment of homeownership.</p>

    <h3>Financial Considerations:</h3>
    <p>Renting may require a security deposit and monthly rent payments, which can vary based on
        location, property size, amenities, and market conditions.</p>

    <h3>Responsibilities:</h3>
    <p>Tenants typically have fewer maintenance responsibilities compared to homeowners, as
        landlords are generally responsible for property repairs and maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Lease Agreements:</h3>
    <p>Rental agreements outline terms such as rent amount, lease duration, security deposit, rules
        on pets or smoking, and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.</p>

    <h2>Factors to Consider When Renting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Budget: Determine how much you can afford to spend on rent each month based on your
            income and expenses.
        </li>
        <li>Location: Consider proximity to work, schools, amenities, and public transportation when
            choosing a rental property.
        </li>
        <li>Property Type: Decide between renting an apartment, house, condominium, or other types
            of properties based on your preferences and needs.
        </li>
        <li>Amenities: Evaluate the amenities offered by the rental property such as parking,
            laundry facilities, security features, and recreational areas.
        </li>
        <li>Lease Terms: Review the lease agreement carefully to understand rental terms, renewal
            options, maintenance responsibilities, and any restrictions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pros of Renting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexibility: Easier to relocate for job opportunities or lifestyle changes.</li>
        <li>Lower Upfront Costs: Typically requires a security deposit and first month's rent
            instead of a large down payment.
        </li>
        <li>Maintenance: Landlords are responsible for property maintenance and repairs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cons of Renting:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited Control: Restrictions on making changes to the property or decor.</li>
        <li>Rent Increases: Landlords may raise rent prices at the end of a lease term.</li>
        <li>No Equity Building: Rent payments do not contribute to building equity in a property.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rental Market Trends:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rental prices can fluctuate based on factors like location demand, economic conditions,
            housing supply, and seasonal trends.
        </li>
        <li>Urban areas or regions with high demand may have higher rental prices compared to rural
            areas.
        </li>
    </ul>
