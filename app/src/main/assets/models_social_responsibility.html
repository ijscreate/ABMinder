<h2>Models and Frameworks of Social Responsibility</h2>
<p>Organizations should operate ethically and with concern for social, cultural, economic, and
    environmental issues according to the concept of social responsibility. This can manifest in
    various ways, from corporate donations to community outreach programs.</p>

<p>However, the interpretation of social responsibility depends on the philosophical outlook of
    entrepreneurs. Two prominent models are:</p>

<div>
    <h3>The Stockholder Theory</h3>
    <p>The Stockholder Theory, also known as the Shareholder Theory, is a business philosophy that
        prioritizes the interests of shareholders above all other stakeholders. This theory posits
        that the primary objective of a corporation is to maximize profits for its shareholders, and
        any action that does not contribute to this goal may be viewed negatively.</p>
    <p>The theory is based on the idea that shareholders are the owners of the company, and they
        have the right to expect a return on their investment. This return is typically in the form
        of dividends or capital gains, and it is the responsibility of the company's management to
        ensure that these returns are maximized.</p>
    <p>One of the key features of the Stockholder Theory is the concept of stockholder voting
        rights. These rights give shareholders the power to vote on corporate matters, such as the
        election of directors, the issuance of additional shares, and corporate takeovers. By
        exercising these rights, shareholders can protect their investment and ensure that the
        company is being managed in a way that maximizes their returns.</p>
    <p>For example, in the case of a corporate takeover, the shareholders of the target company
        typically have the final say on whether the transaction goes through. This allows them to
        protect their investment from potentially detrimental changes of control. Similarly, in the
        election of directors, stockholder voting rights can dictate the composition of the board
        and ensure that it is aligned with the interests of the shareholders.</p>
    <p>However, the Stockholder Theory has been criticized for its narrow focus on shareholder
        interests. Critics argue that it ignores the needs and interests of other stakeholders, such
        as employees, customers, and the community. They argue that a corporation has a broader
        social responsibility to consider the impact of its actions on all of its stakeholders, not
        just its shareholders.</p>

    <h3>Stakeholder Theory</h3>
    <p>According to Edward Freeman's stakeholder theory, a company's stakeholders comprise anyone
        who is affected by the company's operations. Customers, employees, suppliers, political
        action organizations, environmental groups, local communities, the media, financial
        institutions, governmental groups, and other stakeholders, according to Dr. Freeman, are
        "those groups without whose support the corporation would cease to exist." This perspective
        depicts the corporate environment as an ecosystem of interconnected groups that must all be
        considered and satisfied in order for the organization to remain healthy and successful in
        the long run. In his books, Dr. Freeman explains how a thriving firm never loses sight of
        everyone who contributes to its success. According to the stakeholder theory, if a company
        treats its employees badly, it will eventually fail. If it imposes its initiatives on
        communities, the same thing will almost certainly happen. "To genuinely prosper, a company
        cannot ignore any of its stakeholders." In an interview, Dr. Freeman stated that "There may
        be short-term profits, but the company will not exist if stakeholders are unsatisfied and
        feel betrayed."</p>

    <h4>Considerations for Stakeholders:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Employees:</strong> Employees want to be treated as equals, be justly
            compensated, and work normal hours. Employee attitudes and buy-in to the company will
            deteriorate if the company underpays them or assigns them long and difficult work
            shifts. Negative consequences include a high rate of attrition, negative word-of-mouth
            among potential employees, and a weakened organization.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Suppliers:</strong> Suppliers should be treated and paid appropriately, as
            neglecting them can lead to adverse outcomes similar to those observed with employees.
            The condo firm should conduct due diligence on how the supply companies conduct business
            for long-term success.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturers:</strong> Working conditions and wages of manufacturers and their
            employees must be fair and equitable for long-term success.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Environmentalists:</strong> Environmental concerns should be addressed
            transparently to ensure the protection of the local ecology, keeping stakeholders
            informed and involved in project plans and developments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Housing activists:</strong> Local activists' concerns, such as parking
            availability, services for residents, and displacement of long-time residents, should be
            considered to gain their support and enhance community relations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Governmental bodies:</strong> Compliance with governmental regulations and
            concerns, including density, environmental, and design restrictions, is crucial for
            project approval and ongoing support.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Neighbors:</strong> Consideration for the quality of life of neighboring
            residents, including parking, green space, and shared amenities, is essential for
            maintaining or enhancing community relations.
        </li>
