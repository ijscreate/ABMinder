</header>

<section>

    <div class="definition">
        <h3>A. Multiplication of Decimals:</h3>
        <p>Multiplication of decimals is a crucial mathematical operation used in various real-life
            scenarios, such as calculating distances, areas, and financial transactions. In this
            section, we explore the step-by-step process of multiplying decimals, emphasizing the
            correct placement of the decimal point in the result.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a scenario where you need to multiply the distance
            traveled (3.25 km) by the speed (2.4 km/h) to find the total distance covered. We
            illustrate how to perform this multiplication and interpret the result in a meaningful
            way.</p>

        <p><strong>Write down the multiplication:</strong> 3.25 km * 2.4 km/h</p>
        <p><strong>Multiply the decimals:</strong> 3.25 * 2.4 = 7.8</p>
        <p><strong>Consider units:</strong> The units are multiplied as well, so the result is 7.8
            km</p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The total distance covered is 7.8 km</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
        <h3>B. Division of Decimals:</h3>
        <p>Division of decimals is an essential operation used for tasks like calculating average
            values, rates, and proportions. This section provides a detailed guide on dividing
            decimals, emphasizing the process of adjusting the decimal point in the quotient.
            Real-world applications and examples enhance the understanding of how to apply division
            of decimals in practical situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Explore a scenario where you need to divide the total distance
            traveled (5.4 km) by the time taken (1.8 hours) to find the average speed. We guide you
            through the steps of decimal division and demonstrate how to interpret the quotient in
            the context of the problem.</p>

        <!--
        <p><strong>Write down the division:</strong> 5.4 km / 1.8 h</p>
        <p><strong>Perform the division:</strong> 5.4 / 1.8 = 3</p>
        <p><strong>Consider units:</strong> The units are divided as well, so the result is 3 km/h
        </p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The average speed is 3 km/h</p>  -->

        <h3>Decimal Problems and Solutions</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem 1: Calculating Expenses</strong></p>
        <p>Suppose you are shopping for some items, and each item is priced at ₱887.26. If you decide
            to buy 8 items, you need to calculate the total cost of the items to understand the
            financial impact of your shopping choices. This problem involves multiplication of a
            decimal number by a whole number.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To calculate the total cost, multiply the price per item
            (₱887.26) by the number of items (8).</p>
        <p>₱887.26 × 8 = ₱7098.08</p>
        <p>Here's how to calculate the total cost:</p>
        <img src="file:///android_asset/step1.jpg" alt="Decimal Division">
        <img src="file:///android_asset/step2.jpg" alt="Decimal Division">
        <img src="file:///android_asset/step3.jpg" alt="Decimal Division">
        <img src="file:///android_asset/step4.jpg" alt="Decimal Division">
        <img src="file:///android_asset/step5.jpg" alt="Decimal Division">

        <p>By multiplying the price per item by the quantity, you determine the overall cost of the
            items. In this case, purchasing 8 items at ₱887.26 each results in a total expense of
            ₱7098.08. This calculation is essential for budgeting and understanding the financial
            impact of your shopping choices.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem 3: Determining Paint Cans Needed for a Wall</strong></p>
        <p>Imagine you are tasked with painting a rectangular wall, and you want to estimate the
            number of paint cans required to cover the entire surface. The wall measures 15 feet in
            length and 10 feet in height, and each paint can covers an area of 100 square feet.
            Calculate the number of paint cans needed for this painting project. This problem
            involves the division of a whole number by another whole number.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To determine the necessary paint cans, divide the total wall
            area (length × height) by the coverage provided by a single paint can.</p>
        <p>Total Wall Area = 15 feet × 10 feet = 150 square feet</p>
        <p>Number of Paint Cans = Total Wall Area ÷ Coverage per Can</p>
        <p>Number of Paint Cans = 150 square feet ÷ 100 square feet/can = 1.5 cans</p>
        <p>Here's how to calculate the required paint cans:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the length of the wall: 15 feet</li>
            <li>Measure the height of the wall: 10 feet</li>
            <li>Calculate the total wall area: 15 feet × 10 feet = 150 square feet</li>
            <li>Divide the total wall area by the coverage per paint can: 150 square feet ÷ 100
                square feet/can = 1.5 cans
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By performing this calculation, you determine that 1.5 paint cans are needed to cover the
            entire wall. Since you cannot purchase a fraction of a paint can, you would need to
            round up to 2 cans to ensure complete coverage.</p>
        <p>Understanding this helps you plan for the appropriate amount of paint, ensuring a
            successful and visually appealing painting project.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem 3: Sharing Monthly Internet Bill</strong></p>
        <p>Your monthly internet bill is $45.50, and you share it with two roommates. To determine
            each person's contribution, you need to divide the total bill ($45.50) by the number of
            people sharing it (3).</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To find the contribution per person, divide the total bill
            ($45.50) by the number of people sharing it (3).</p>
        <p>$45.50 / 3 ≈ $15.17/person</p>
        <p>Here's how to calculate the contribution per person:</p>
        <p>Write down the total bill: $45.50</p>
        <p>Write down the number of people sharing the bill: 3 (including you)</p>
        <p>Divide the total bill by the number of people sharing it to find the contribution per
            person:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$45.50 / 3 ≈ $15.17</li>
            <li>First, divide 45 by 3, which equals 15 with no remainder.</li>
            <li>The contribution per person is $15.17, ensuring fairness in sharing expenses among
                the roommates.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To determine each person's share, divide the total bill by the number of roommates. In
            this case, each of the three roommates needs to contribute approximately $15.17 towards
            the monthly internet bill. This equitable distribution ensures fairness in sharing
            expenses among the roommates.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem 4: Lily's Cloth Usage</strong></p>
        <p>Lily used some cloth to make 4 banners and a tablecloth. She used 1.95 m of cloth for
            each banner and 1.24 m of cloth for the tablecloth. You need to calculate how many
            meters of cloth she used altogether. This problem involves multiplication and addition
            of decimal numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Find the total length of cloth used to make the 4 banners:</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>1.95 × 4 = 7.8</li>
            <li>The total length of cloth used to make the 4 banners was 7.8 m.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Find the total length of cloth Lily used altogether:</p>

            <figcaption>https://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/ari263.gif</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>7.8 + 1.24 = 9.04</li>
            <li>Lily used 9.04 m of cloth altogether.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By calculating the total length of cloth used for the banners and the tablecloth, you can
            determine that Lily used 9.04 m of cloth altogether.</p>
