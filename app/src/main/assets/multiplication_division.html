    <h2>Lesson 1.1: Addition and Subtraction of Fractions in Business Mathematics</h2>
</header>

<div class="card">
    <h2>Section 1.1.1: Adding Fractions</h2>

    <p>In various business scenarios, the need to combine and analyze fractional parts arises,
        making this
        skill integral to accurate calculations. This section will guide you through the process of
        adding fractions with real-world examples.</p>

    <p>Understanding how to add fractions is a fundamental skill for anyone engaged in
        business-related
        computations. Whether you're dealing with inventory, financial transactions, or resource
        allocation, the ability to work with fractions is crucial for precise and informed
        decision-making.</p>

    <p>Adding fractions involves more than just arithmetic; it requires a conceptual understanding
        of
        how different parts contribute to a whole. In the context of business mathematics, this
        skill
        becomes a powerful tool for managers, analysts, and anyone involved in financial
        planning.</p>

    <p>As we delve into the intricacies of adding fractions, we'll explore scenarios that mimic
        real-world business situations. Through examples and step-by-step explanations, you'll gain
        the
        expertise needed to handle fractional components accurately and efficiently.</p>

    <p>Remember, the proficiency to add fractions is not only about calculations but also about
        interpreting results in a meaningful way. This lesson aims to equip you with the knowledge
        and
        skills necessary to navigate the world of business mathematics with confidence.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>

    <p>The process of adding fractions involves consolidating parts of a whole, a skill essential
        for
        tasks such as inventory management and financial analysis. Consider a scenario where a
        business
        needs to evaluate its daily inventory turnover. If 1/4 of the stock is sold on Monday and an
        additional 3/8 on Tuesday, the objective is to determine the cumulative proportion sold over
        the
        two days.</p>

    <h3>Example 1.1.1:</h3>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Finding a Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the least common multiple of 4 and 8, which is 8.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Rewriting Fractions with the Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>1/4</code> becomes <code>2/8</code>.</li>
        <li><code>3/8</code> remains <code>3/8</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Adding the Fractions</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>2/8 + 3/8 = 5/8</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore, the company has successfully sold <code>5/8</code> of its inventory over the two
        days.
    </p>

    <h3>Example 1.1.2: Combining Fractional Investments</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Finding a Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the least common multiple of 3 and 5, which is 15.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Rewriting Fractions with the Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>1/3</code> becomes <code>5/15</code>.</li>
        <li><code>2/5</code> becomes <code>6/15</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Adding the Fractions</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>5/15 + 6/15 = 11/15</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore, the combined ownership stake in the project is <code>11/15</code>.</p>

    <h2>Section 1.1.2: Subtracting Fractions</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <p>In this part of the lesson, we will explore the nuanced process of subtracting fractions,
            a
            critical skill for maintaining financial accuracy in business mathematics.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>

    <p>Subtracting fractions is crucial for tasks such as calculating profit margins, determining
        changes in quantities, and analyzing financial data. Imagine a scenario where a business,
        mindful of budget constraints, has 3/10 of its budget remaining at the end of the first
        quarter.
        If it spends an additional 2/5 of the remaining budget in the second quarter, the goal is to
        ascertain the residual budget after the second quarter.</p>

    <h3>Example 1.1.2:</h3>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Finding a Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the least common multiple of 5 and 10, which is 10.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Rewriting Fractions with the Common Denominator</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>3/10</code> remains <code>3/10</code>.</li>
        <li><code>2/5</code> becomes <code>4/10</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Subtracting the Fractions</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>3/10 - 4/10 = -1/10</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The business, at the conclusion of the second quarter, faced a deficit equivalent to
        <code>-1/10</code> of the budget.</p>
