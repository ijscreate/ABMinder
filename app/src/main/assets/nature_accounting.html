<section>
    <h3>Scope of Accounting</h3>
    <p>Accounting has a wide scope and application, not limited to the business world. It
        encompasses all spheres of society and professions. Financial transactions occur in social
        institutions, professional activities, government bodies, and more, necessitating the
        recording, summarizing, interpretation, and communication of financial information.</p>
    <p>Modern accounting is practiced not only in business institutions but also in non-trading
        entities such as schools, hospitals, and government bodies. Additionally, professionals like
        medical practitioners, lawyers, and chartered accountants utilize accounting methods to
        manage financial transactions.</p>
    <p>The scope of accounting has expanded over time, adapting to socio-economic changes. New areas
        of application, such as national accounting, human resources accounting, and social
        accounting, have emerged through continuous research in the field.</p>

    <h3>Nature of Accounting</h3>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Accounting is a Process</h3>
        <p>Accounting involves multiple systematic steps, including identifying, recording,
            classifying, summarizing, and communicating financial data, with the end goal of
            providing financial information to internal and external parties.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Accounting is an Art</h3>
        <p>Accounting requires creativity, skill, and expertise to apply various techniques and
            methods in recording, classifying, summarizing, and communicating financial data. It
            combines technical skills with creative problem-solving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Accounting Deals with Financial Information and Transactions</h3>
        <p>Accounting focuses on quantifiable financial transactions with monetary value,
            objectively measured. Nonfinancial transactions are not the focus, although nonfinancial
            data may be used to interpret financial data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Accounting is a Means and Not an End</h3>
        <p>Accounting is a tool used to achieve specific objectives, such as creating value for
            stakeholders. It provides financial information for decision-making but is not the
            objective itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature">
        <h3>Accounting is an Information System</h3>
        <p>Accounting collects, processes, and communicates financial information to internal and
            external stakeholders. It is a service function that provides objective, reliable, and
            relevant financial information for decision-making.</p>
