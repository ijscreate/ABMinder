    <h2>Oligopoly</h2>
    <p>Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by a small number of large firms dominating the
        market. These firms have significant market power, which allows them to influence market
        prices and output levels. Oligopolies can lead to complex interactions among firms,
        strategic decision-making, and potential collusion.</p>

    <div class="characteristics">
        <h>Key Characteristics of Oligopoly</h>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Few Large Firms:</strong> In an oligopoly, there are only a few dominant
                firms that control a significant portion of the market share. These firms can impact
                industry dynamics and compete with each other for market dominance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interdependence:</strong> Firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, meaning
                that the actions of one firm can have a direct impact on the others. Strategic
                decisions made by one firm can trigger responses from competitors, leading to a game
                of strategic interactions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> Oligopolies often have high barriers to entry,
                such as economies of scale, high capital requirements, or exclusive access to
                resources. These barriers limit new firms from entering the market and competing
                with existing oligopolistic firms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> Firms in oligopolies may differentiate
                their products through branding, quality, features, or marketing strategies to
                create a competitive advantage. This differentiation can help firms maintain market
                share and customer loyalty.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Price Competition:</strong> Oligopolistic firms often engage in
                non-price competition by focusing on product differentiation, advertising,
                innovation, and customer service to attract and retain customers. This type of
                competition can lead to improved product quality and innovation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Price Leadership:</strong> In some cases, an oligopoly may exhibit price
                leadership, where one dominant firm sets the price and other firms in the industry
                follow suit. This can help maintain price stability in the market.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Collusion:</strong> Oligopolistic firms may engage in collusion to
                coordinate their actions and manipulate prices or output levels to maximize profits
                collectively. Collusion can take the form of price-fixing agreements or
                market-sharing arrangements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Competition and Cooperation:</strong> While firms in an oligopoly compete
                with each other for market share and profits, they may also cooperate through
                strategic alliances, joint ventures, or research and development partnerships to
                achieve mutual benefits.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Government Regulation:</strong> Oligopolies are closely monitored by
                antitrust authorities to prevent anti-competitive behavior, such as price-fixing or
                collusion. Government regulations aim to promote fair competition and protect
                consumer welfare in oligopolistic markets.

        <h4>Example of Oligopoly in the Airline Industry</h4>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Few Dominant Firms:</strong> In the airline industry, there are a few major
                carriers such as Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines, and Southwest
                Airlines that dominate the market. These airlines control a significant portion of
                the market share and compete with each other for passengers and routes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interdependence:</strong> Firms in the airline industry are highly
                interdependent. When one airline makes a strategic decision, such as lowering fares
                on a particular route, other airlines may respond by matching or adjusting their
                prices to remain competitive. This strategic interaction can lead to price wars or
                adjustments in service offerings.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Barriers to Entry:</strong> The airline industry has high barriers to entry,
                including high capital requirements for purchasing aircraft, regulatory hurdles, and
                established route networks. New airlines face challenges in entering the market and
                competing with existing carriers, leading to limited competition.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> Airlines differentiate their services
                through factors such as flight schedules, cabin classes, in-flight amenities,
                loyalty programs, and customer service. This differentiation allows airlines to
                attract different segments of passengers based on their preferences and needs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Non-Price Competition:</strong> Airlines engage in non-price competition by
                offering unique services and amenities to differentiate themselves from competitors.
                This includes features such as upgraded seating options, entertainment systems,
                on-board Wi-Fi, and partnerships with hotels and car rental companies.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Price Leadership:</strong> In the airline industry, one major carrier may
                act as a price leader by setting fares for certain routes or markets. Other airlines
                often follow the lead of the price leader to maintain price stability and avoid
                aggressive pricing strategies that could harm profitability across the industry.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Collusion Concerns:</strong> Antitrust authorities closely monitor the
                airline industry to prevent anti-competitive behavior such as collusion among major
                carriers to fix prices or limit capacity. Collusive practices can harm consumers by
                reducing choices and leading to higher fares.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Alliances:</strong> Airlines form strategic alliances and
                partnerships to expand their route networks, share resources, and offer passengers a
                wider range of destinations. These alliances can enhance the competitiveness of
                airlines in the global market and improve customer convenience.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Government Regulation:</strong> The airline industry is subject to extensive
                government regulation concerning safety standards, route allocations, pricing
                practices, consumer rights, and environmental policies. Regulatory oversight aims to
                ensure fair competition and protect consumer interests.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <p>Understanding oligopoly is crucial for analyzing market dynamics, pricing strategies, and
        strategic interactions among firms in industries dominated by a small number of large
        players. It represents a complex market structure that requires careful consideration of
        competitive strategies and regulatory oversight.</p>
