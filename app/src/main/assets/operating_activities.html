    <h2>Operating Activities</h2>
    <p>Operating activities are the core activities that a business performs to earn revenue. These
        activities affect the cash flow coming in and out and determine the net income of the
        business. They are found in the business’ financial statements, particularly the cash flow
        statement, and are considered the most important section since it provides cash flow and
        determines the business’ ability to pay its current expenses such as labor costs and debt
        repayment.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Operating Activities Resulting in Revenue Generation:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cash receipts from sales</li>

        <li>Settlements of lawsuits and insurance claims</li>
        <li>Accounts receivables collection</li>

        operating activities include depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and gains and
        losses from the sale of plant assets and the retirement of bonds.</p>
    <h3>Preparation Methods for Operating Activities Section:</h3>

        methods: Indirect Method and Direct Method. Both methods calculate the same total of cash
        flows from operating activities, but the methodologies are different.</p>
