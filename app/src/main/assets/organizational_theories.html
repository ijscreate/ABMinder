<h1>Organizational Theories</h1>

<h2>Classical Organizational Theory</h2>
<p>The classical perspective of management originated during the Industrial Revolution. It focuses
    primarily on efficiency and productivity and does not take into account behavioral attributes of
    employees. Classical organizational theory combines aspects of scientific management,
    bureaucratic theory and administrative theory. Scientific management involves obtaining optimal
    equipment and personnel and then carefully scrutinizing each component of the production
    process. Bureaucratic theory places importance on establishing a hierarchical structure of
    power. Administrative theory strives to establish universal management principles relevant to
    all organizations.</p>

<h2>Neoclassical Organizational Theory</h2>
<p>Neoclassical organizational theory is a reaction to the authoritarian structure of classical
    theory. The neoclassical approach emphasizes the human needs of employees to be happy in the
    workplace. This allows creativity, individual growth and motivation, which increases
    productivity and profits. Managers utilizing the neoclassical approach manipulate the work
    environment to produce positive results.</p>

<h2>Contingency Theory</h2>
<p>Contingency theory accepts that there is no universally ideal leadership style because each
    organization faces unique circumstances internally and externally. In contingency theory,
    productivity is a function of a managerâ€™s ability to adapt to environmental changes. Managerial
    authority is especially important for highly volatile industries. This allows managers the
    freedom to make decisions based on current situations. The contingency theory reveals situations
    that require more intense focus and takes account of unique circumstances.</p>

<h2>Systems Theory</h2>
<p>Systems theorists believe all organizational components are interrelated. Changes in one
    component may affect all other components. Systems theory views organizations as open systems in
    a state of dynamic equilibrium, which are continually changing and adapting to environment and
    circumstance. Nonlinear relationships between organizational components create a complex
    understanding of organizations in systems theory.</p>
