<h2>ORGANIZING</h2>

<p><strong>What is Organization: Nature of Organization?</strong></p>
<p>The concept of organization has evolved from the commencement of human civilization when they
    started to live in groups. It means that the family is the beginning form of organization. But
    nowadays, people have to form different types of organizations based on their goals consisting
    of business, social, religious, clubs and so on.</p>
<p>Groups of people are associated and coordinated for achieving common goals. Members having
    similar interests and goals become ready to form a group for a joint effort with different tasks
    and responsibilities. The division of works is carried out on the basis of the efficiency and
    specialization of the group members. Activities of each member get coordinated with the help of
    an effective communication network. Responsibility and authority are delegated based on the
    structure of the organization.</p>
<p>An organization comes into existence when a number of persons willing to contribute their efforts
    to achieve a common goal. It is a human association for the attainment of a common goal. In
    common sense, a group that is formed by two or more persons to achieve a common objective is
    called an organization. In other words, the organization is an association of two or more
    individuals working together in a coordinated manner to achieve common goals. It is a collection
    of people working together with a division of labor or work to achieve a common purpose. When
    people decide to accomplish any work or job for mutual benefit, they need to form an
    organization.</p>
<p>In fact, work or job that cannot be performed by a single person, but can be performed
    effectively in a group. People should join organizations when they could not perform the work or
    job in an effective manner.</p>
<p>Basically, the nature of organization can be viewed in two ways: (1) Organization as a process
    (2) Organization as a structure or framework of relationship!</p>

<p><strong>Organization as a Process:</strong></p>
<p>As a process, organization is an executive function. it becomes a managerial function involving
    the following activities:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Determining activities necessary for the accomplishment of the business objectives</li>
    <li>Division of work</li>
    <li>Grouping of inter-related activities</li>
    <li>Assigning duties to persons with requisite competence</li>
    <li>Delegating authority</li>
    <li>Coordinating the efforts of different persons and groups</li>
</ol>
<p>When we consider organization as a process, it becomes the function of every manager. Organizing
    is a continuous process and goes on throughout the lifetime of an enterprise. Whenever there is
    a change in the circumstances or material change in situation, new type of activity springs
    up.</p>
<p>So, there is a need for constant review and re-assignment of duties. Right persons have to be
    recruited and necessary training imparted to make them competent to handle the jobs.</p>
<p>The process of organization thus, involves dividing the work in a rational way and integrating
    the activities with work situations and personnel. It also represents humanistic view of the
    enterprise since it is the people who are uppermost in the process of integration of activities.
    Continuous review and adjustment makes it dynamic as well.</p>

<p><strong>Organization as a Structure (or, Framework of Relationships):</strong></p>
<p>As a structure, organization is a network of internal authority and responsibility relationships.
    It is the framework of relationships of persons operating at various levels to accomplish common
    objectives. An organization structure is a systematic combination of people, functions and
    physical facilities. It constitutes a formal structure with definite authority and clear
    responsibility. It has to be first designed for determining the channel of communication and
    flow of authority and responsibility. For this, different types of analysis have to be done.
    Peter F Drucker suggests following three types of analysis:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Activities analysis</li>
    <li>Decision analysis</li>
    <li>Relations analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>A hierarchy has to be built-up i.e., a hierarchy of positions with clearly defined authority and
    responsibility. The accountability of each functionary has to be specified. Therefore, it has to
    be put into practice. In a way, organization can be called a system as well.</p>
<p>The main emphasis here is on relationships or structure rather than on persons. The structure
    once built is not liable to change so soon. This concept of organization is, thus, a static one.
    It is also called classical concept. Organization charts are prepared depicting the relationship
    of different persons.</p>
<p>In an organization structure, both formal and informal organizations take shape. The former is a
    pre-planned one and defined by the executive action. The latter is a spontaneous formation,
    being laid down by the common sentiments, interactions and other interrelated attributes of the
    people in the organization. Both formal and informal organizations, thus, have structure.</p>

<h2>Types of Organizational Structures</h2>

<p><strong>Line Organizational Structure</strong></p>
<p>Line organizational structure is one of the simplest types of organizational structures. Its
    authority flows from top to bottom. Unlike other structures, specialized and supportive services
    do not take place in these organizations. The chain of command and each department head has
    control over their departments. The self-contained department structure can be seen as its main
    characteristic. Independent decisions can be taken by line officers because of its unified
    structure. The main advantage of a line organizational structure can be identified as the
    effective communication that brings stability to the organization.</p>

<p><strong>Functional Organizational Structure</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve had a job, you likely worked in a functional organizational structure. The functional
    structure is based on an organization being divided up into smaller groups with specific tasks
    or roles. For example, a company could have a group working in information technology, another
    in marketing and another in finance. Each department has a manager or director who answers to an
    executive a level up in the hierarchy who may oversee multiple departments. One such example is
    a director of marketing who supervises the marketing department and answers to a vice president
    who is in charge of the marketing, finance and IT divisions. An advantage of this structure is
    employees are grouped by skill set and function, allowing them to focus their collective
    energies on executing their roles as a department.</p>
<p>One of the challenges this structure presents is a lack of inter-departmental communication, with
    most issues and discussions taking place at the managerial level among individual departments.
    For example, one department working with another on a project may have different expectations or
    details for its specific job, which could lead to issues down the road. In addition, with groups
    paired by job function, there’s the possibility employees can develop “tunnel vision” — seeing
    the company solely through the lens of the employee’s job function.</p>

<p><strong>Divisional Organizational Structure</strong></p>
<p>Larger companies that operate across several horizontal objectives sometimes use a divisional
    organizational structure. This structure allows for much more autonomy among groups within the
    organization. One example of this is a company like General Electric. GE has many different
    divisions including aviation, transportation, currents, digital and renewable energy, among
    others. Under this structure, each division essentially operates as its own company, controlling
    its own resources and how much money it spends on certain projects or aspects of the
    division.</p>

<p><strong>Matrix Organizational Structure</strong></p>
<p>A hybrid organizational structure, the matrix structure is a blend of the functional
    organizational structure and the project organizational structure. In the matrix structure,
    employees may report to two or more bosses depending on the situation or project. For example,
    under normal functional circumstances, an engineer at a large engineering firm could work for
    one boss, but a new project may arise where that engineer’s expertise is needed. For the
    duration of that project, the employee would also report to that project’s manager, as well as
    his or her boss for all other daily tasks. The matrix structure is challenging because it can be
    tough reporting to multiple bosses and knowing what to communicate to them. That’s why it’s very
    important for the employees to know their roles, responsibilities and work priorities.
    Advantages of this structure is that employees can share their knowledge across the different
    functional divisions, allowing for better communication and understanding of each function’s
    role. And by working across functions, employees can broaden their skills and knowledge, leading
    to professional growth within the company. On the other hand, reporting to multiple managers may
    add confusion and conflict between managers over what should be reported. And if priorities are
    not clearly defined, employees, too, may get confused about their roles.</p>
