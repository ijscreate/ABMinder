    <h2>Another Comprehensive Income</h2>
    <p>Another Comprehensive Income is composed of income and expenses that are not presented as
        profit or loss as required by the Philippine Financial Reporting Standards. These are
        special accounts such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unrealized gain or loss on investment in equity instrument measured at fair value
            through other comprehensive income
        </li>
        <li>Gain or loss from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation</li>
        <li>Change in revaluation surplus</li>
        <li>Unrealized gain or loss from derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedge</li>
        <li>Actuarial gain or loss on defined benefits plan by the full recognition approach</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) is a financial term that refers to revenues, expenses,
        gains, and losses that have not yet been realized. It is an important measure of a company's
        value, particularly for larger corporations. OCI includes items such as unrealized gains or
        losses on financial assets, gains or losses from translating the financial statements of a
        foreign operation, revaluation surplus, unrealized gains or losses from derivative contracts
        designated as cash flow hedge, and actuarial gain or loss on defined benefit plans.</p>
    <p>In the Philippines, OCI is not part of retained earnings but is instead reported separately
        on the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). It is not the same as
        comprehensive income, which is the sum of net income and OCI. OCI is not included in the
        income statement but is instead reported in the balance sheet.</p>
    <p>A common example of OCI is a bond portfolio that is not classified as held-to-maturity. If
        the value of the bonds in the portfolio changes, the unrealized gain or loss is recognized
        in OCI until the bonds are sold. At that point, the gain or loss is realized and flows
        through to the income statement.</p>
    <p>OCI is an important financial measure because it provides insight into a company's financial
        performance beyond its core operations. It is particularly useful for investors who are
        interested in understanding the potential for realized gains or losses on the income
        statement down the road. By tracking OCI over time, investors can gain a more complete
        picture of a company's financial health and potential for future growth.</p>
