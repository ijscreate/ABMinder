<h2>An Overview of Outstanding Checks</h2>
<p>An outstanding check is a check that has been issued by a company or individual but has not yet
    been cashed or deposited and cleared by the bank. This creates a discrepancy between the bank
    balance and the true amount of cash available to the company or individual.</p>

<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Outstanding checks are subtracted from the ending balance on the bank statement when
        computing the adjusted balance per bank in the bank reconciliation process.
    </li>
    <li>If outstanding checks are not cleared within a certain period, they may be considered
        unclaimed property and must be turned over to the respective state government.
    </li>
    <li>Individuals need to account for outstanding checks when balancing their checkbooks to ensure
        accurate financial management.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact on Financial Statements:</h2>
<p>Recording outstanding checks in accounting software affects the balance sheet, as they represent
    checks that have been issued but not yet processed by the bank. Failure to manage outstanding
    checks effectively can lead to financial challenges such as overdraft fees and incorrect
    financial reporting.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Outstanding checks are an important aspect of financial management, and it is crucial for
    businesses and individuals to keep track of them to avoid financial discrepancies and
    challenges.</p>
