        <h3>Definition of Partnership</h3>
        <p>A partnership is a business structure in which two or more individuals manage and operate
            a business
            in accordance with the terms and objectives set out in a Partnership Deed. Each partner
            shares a
            portion of the partnership's profits and losses and each partner is personally liable
            for the debt and
            obligations of the partnership.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A partnership is a formal arrangement by two or more parties to manage and operate a
                business and
                share its profits.
            </li>
            <li>There are several types of partnership arrangements, including general partnerships,
                limited
                partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.
            </li>
            <li>In a general partnership, each partner is personally liable for the debts and
                obligations of the
                business.
            </li>
            <li>In a limited partnership, there are both general partners and limited partners.
                General partners
                have full liability for the partnership's debts, while limited partners' liabilities
                are limited to
                their investment.
            </li>
            <li>In a limited liability partnership, all partners have limited liability, protecting
                them from
                potential lawsuits against the partnership.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Partnership</h3>
        <p>A partnership is a business with multiple owners, each of whom has invested in the
            business. Some
            partnerships include individuals who work in the business, while other may include
            partners who have
            limited participation and also limited liability.</p>
        <p>Partnerships are generally easy to establish and can be formed with minimal formalities.
            Partnerships
            are not typically subject to the same extensive regulatory requirements and
            administrative filings as
            corporations. However, partnerships must file an annual information return to report
            income, deductions,
            gains, losses, etc.</p>
    </section>

    <div>
        <h3>Types of Partnerships</h3>
        <p>In a general partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and
            liabilities of the partnership. This means that each partner is individually responsible
            for the partnership's debts and liabilities, and if one partner is unable to pay their
            share, the other partners may be required to cover the deficit.</p>

                                partners, who report them on their individual tax returns,
                                simplifying tax compliance.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Unlimited liability: Partners have unlimited personal liability for
                                the debts and obligations of the partnership, putting their personal
                                assets at risk.

                            <li>Shared profits: Partners must share the profits of the business
                                equally or as agreed upon in the partnership agreement, regardless
                                of their individual contributions.
                            </li>
                            <li>Conflict between partners: Disagreements between partners can arise
                                over management decisions, profit distribution, or other aspects of
                                the business.
                            </li>
                            <li>Joint decision-making: Partners must make decisions collectively,
                                which can lead to delays or disagreements if partners cannot reach a
                                consensus.

                            <li>Partnership dissolutions: General partnerships may dissolve if one
                                partner decides to leave the business or if the partnership
                                agreement expires, leading to potential disruptions in operations.
                            </li>

        <p>In a limited liability partnership, the liability of the general partners is limited to
            the amount they have invested in the partnership. This means that if the partnership
            incurs debts or liabilities, the general partners are only responsible for the amount
            they have invested, and not for the entire debt or liability of the partnership.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Limited liability: Partners have limited personal liability for the
                                debts and obligations of the LLP, protecting their personal assets
                                from business liabilities.
                            </li>
                            <li>Separate legal entity: An LLP is a separate legal entity from its
                                partners, allowing it to enter into contracts, own property, and
                                conduct business in its own name.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pass-through taxation: Like general partnerships, LLPs are taxed as
                                pass-through entities, meaning that profits and losses are passed
                                through to the partners and reported on their individual tax
                                returns.
                            </li>
                            <li>Flexibility in management: LLPs offer flexibility in management,
                                allowing partners to participate in the day-to-day operations of the
                                business or take a more hands-off approach, depending on their
                                preferences.
                            </li>
                            <li>Attractiveness to professionals: LLPs are often favored by
                                professionals such as lawyers, accountants, and consultants, who
                                wish to form a partnership while limiting their personal liability.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complex formation: Forming an LLP may be more complex and costly
                                than forming a general partnership, as it requires registration with
                                the appropriate government authorities and compliance with specific
                                legal requirements.
                            </li>
                            <li>Regulatory requirements: LLPs are subject to regulatory requirements
                                and reporting obligations, including filing annual returns and
                                maintaining proper accounting records, which may involve additional
                                administrative burdens and costs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Shared decision-making: Like general partnerships, LLPs require
                                partners to make decisions collectively, which can lead to conflicts
                                or delays in decision-making if partners cannot reach a consensus.
                            </li>
                            <li>Perception of credibility: Some stakeholders, such as lenders or
                                customers, may perceive LLPs as less credible or stable compared to
                                corporations, which may affect the LLP's ability to attract
                                financing or business opportunities.
                            </li>
                            <li>Continuity concerns: LLPs may face continuity concerns if partners
                                decide to leave the partnership or if there are changes in
                                ownership, which could disrupt business operations or lead to the
                                dissolution of the LLP.
                            </li>

        <p>In a limited partnership, there is usually one general partner who is responsible for the
            management and day-to-day operation of the partnership, and one or more silent partners
            who do not participate in the management or operation of the partnership. The silent
            partners are not responsible for the debts or liabilities of the partnership, and they
            do not have any say in the management or operation of the partnership.</p>

                                partnership, protecting their personal assets from business
                                liabilities beyond their initial investment.

                            <li>Passive investment: Limited partners can invest capital in the
                                partnership without being actively involved in its management or
                                day-to-day operations, allowing them to benefit from the
                                partnership's profits without assuming significant management
                                responsibilities.

                            <li>Access to capital: Limited partnerships can attract investors by
                                offering limited liability to limited partners, making them more
                                attractive investment opportunities compared to general partnerships
                                or sole proprietorships.

                            <li>Expertise and resources: Limited partnerships allow general partners
                                to access additional capital, expertise, and resources from limited
                                partners, which can help support the growth and expansion of the
                                business.

                            <li>Tax advantages: Limited partnerships are taxed as pass-through
                                entities, meaning that profits and losses are passed through to the
                                partners and reported on their individual tax returns, potentially
                                resulting in tax benefits for partners.

                                including filing formation documents, maintaining proper records,
                                and complying with securities laws, which can involve significant
                                administrative burdens and costs.

                                conflicts between general and limited partners, particularly
                                regarding decision-making authority, profit-sharing arrangements,
                                and management responsibilities, which can strain the partnership's
                                relationships and hinder its operations.

                                attracting investors or obtaining financing due to concerns about
                                the unlimited liability of general partners and the potential for
                                conflicts between partners, which may affect the partnership's
                                credibility and reputation in the market.

        <p>When drafting a partnership agreement, it is important to clearly define the roles and
            responsibilities of each partner, as well as the specific terms and conditions under
            which the partnership will operate. This can include details about profit sharing,
            expulsion clauses, and the rights and responsibilities of each partner in the management
            and operation of the partnership.</p>
        <p>By understanding the different types of partnerships and their associated liabilities,
            you can make informed decisions about the best structure for your business and its
            partnership arrangements.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>Let's take the example of a law firm, Smith & Jones, which is a general partnership
            between two attorneys, John Smith and Jane Jones. John and Jane have been practicing law
            individually for several years and have decided to combine their practices to better
            serve their clients and expand their business. They each contribute P50,000 in capital
            to start the business and share profits and losses equally.</p>
        <p>As general partners, John and Jane are both responsible for managing the business and
            have unlimited personal liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership. This
            means that if the partnership incurs debt or is sued, both John and Jane are personally
            liable for the amount owed, regardless of their ownership percentage.</p>
        <p>To monitor the financial health of their business, John and Jane use accounting
            information to track income, expenses, and partnership capital. They use financial
            statements, such as income statements and balance sheets, to assess the profitability
            and financial position of the business. This information is also important for tax
            reporting purposes, as partnerships are considered pass-through entities for tax
            purposes, meaning the partnership itself is not taxed, but the partners are taxed on
            their share of the partnership's income.</p>
        <p>John and Jane also use accounting information to make informed decisions about the use of
            resources, such as whether to purchase new office equipment or hire additional staff.
            They may use budgeting and forecasting tools to project future cash flows and make
            informed decisions about the growth and direction of the business.</p>
        <p>In addition to internal users, external users such as creditors and potential investors
            may also be interested in the accounting information of the partnership. Creditors may
            examine the partnership's financial statements to assess the risk associated with
            lending to the partnership, while potential investors may use the information to decide
            if they will invest in the business.</p>
        <p>Overall, accurate and reliable accounting information is crucial for the success of a
            partnership like Smith & Jones. It helps the partners monitor the financial health of
            the business, make informed decisions, and comply with tax reporting requirements. It
            also helps external users make informed decisions about lending to or investing in the
            partnership.</p>
