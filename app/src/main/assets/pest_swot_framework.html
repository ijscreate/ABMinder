<h2 style="text-align: center">PEST and SWOT Analyzes Framework</h2>
<h2>A SWOT Analysis</h2>
<p>A SWOT analysis is a very commonly used strategic framework in business. It is simple to
    understand and provides a great starting point for considering strategic choices. A SWOT
    analysis is also versatile, as it can be applied to a product (for marketing), business unit, or
    entire company—in relation to strategic business goals. A SWOT analysis has two key
    purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To help a company determine its strategic goals</li>
    <li>To provide the foundation for developing a strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>When planning a project, it is important to learn about the internal and external factors that
    can affect the project. There are some excellent strategic planning methods that you can use to
    analyze all these factors. SWOT analysis and PEST analysis are two of the most frequently used
    planning methods. Below is a brief introduction to both methods and a comparison of SWOT
    analysis and PEST analysis.</p>

<h2>What is SWOT Analysis?</h2>
<p>SWOT, when broken down simply, means analyzing the:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Strengths – The advantages you have over the competition concerning this project.</li>
    <li>Weaknesses – The disadvantages you have internally compared with your competitors.</li>
    <li>Opportunities – Current external trends which are waiting to be taken advantage of.</li>
    <li>Threats – External movements which may cause a problem and have a negative impact on your
        business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes SWOT is referred to as SLOT, where weaknesses are named as liabilities. By working
    through each of these points, it is possible to identify any internal disadvantages or
    advantages which could benefit or hinder the outcome of a planned project. In addition to
    evaluating the state internally, this method is also able to identify the external factors which
    could also make a difference to the success or failure of a project.</p>

<h2>SWOT Analysis Components</h2>
<p>SWOT analysis helps enterprises assess their strengths and overcome weaknesses as well as use
    opportunities to sort out threats.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Strengths – Firms need to focus and improve their strengths in order to achieve their goals,
        focusing on USP (unique selling point) and increasing quality of products/services in
        competition of the competitors. Strengths are an internal factor.
    </li>
    <li>Weaknesses – This implies what the company lacks or is unable to achieve. Lower profits in a
        specific department or products plus sales and internal structural problems. Weaknesses need
        to be dealt with since this is also an internal factor.
    </li>
    <li>Opportunity – This is an external factor as it is directly related to the firm’s external
        environment, through which these companies can gain a lot if they plan their moves wisely.
        Firms can benefit from lower taxes, good market trends, and a booming economy.
    </li>
    <li>Threats – Companies don’t have control over threats since they are external factors which
        can create uncertainty. This has a negative impact on the business. Unrest, new competitors,
        and government policies are some examples.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>By conducting and implementing SWOT analysis, firms identify positive and negative aspects and
    then implement this research. Most companies carry out this analysis every month or once a year
    depending on the current situation. It not only helps businesses evaluate their current state
    but also helps in taking countermeasures to overcome barriers and prevent factors from stopping
    them from achieving their full potential.</p>

<h2>Using the Information</h2>
<p>By knowing this information, it can be possible to plan a successful project that is ready to
    work around certain problems effectively and to avoid failure. It is a good idea and excellent
    practice to work through the SWOT Analysis with your team in the early stages of project
    planning. Brainstorming is a great way of introducing all the relevant internal and external
    factors for each section of the analysis.</p>

<h2>What is PEST Analysis?</h2>
<p>PEST stands for the analysis of the external factors which are beneficial when conducting
    research before beginning a new project or to help conduct market research. These factors
    are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Political – Laws, global issues, legislation and regulations which may have an effect on
        your business either immediately or in the future.
    </li>
    <li>Economic – Taxes, interest rates, inflation, the stock markets and consumer confidence all
        need to be taken into account.
    </li>
    <li>Social – The changes in lifestyle and buying trends, media, major events, ethics,
        advertising and publicity factors.
    </li>
    <li>Technological – Innovations, access to technology, licensing and patents, manufacturing,
        research funding, global communications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Pest can also be known as PESTLE which includes other factors such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Legal – Legislation which has been proposed and may come into effect and any passed
        legislations.
    </li>
    <li>Environmental – Environmental issues either locally or globally and their social and
        political factors.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>PEST Analysis Components</h2>
<p>Unlike SWOT, this strategy is more directly aimed at the external macro environmental factors
    that might be affecting the position of your business, the reasons behind growth or decline in
    the market and also identify new directions for the business as a whole.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Political – Political or politically motivated factors that could impact the organization.
    </li>
    <li>Economic – Overall economic forces that could impact on your success.</li>
    <li>Social – Social attitudes, behaviors, and trends that impact on your organization and target
        market.
    </li>
    <li>Technological – Technology that can affect the way you make, distribute, and market your
        products and services.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing SWOT Analysis Vs PEST Analysis</p>
<p>Directly comparing SWOT vs PEST is probably the wrong thing to do. They are both planning methods
    that give tremendous insights for you to successfully execute projects.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of PESTLE analysis is it doesn’t consider the internal factors of your
    organization. It deeply analyzed the external factors that might affect your project or
    organization. So if you plan your projects based only on the PEST analysis you will not have a
    chance to match your strengths to a current need.</p>
<p>SWOT analysis considers both the internal and external factors. It captures the external factors
    in the opportunities and threats section. However, when creating a SWOT diagram a deep analysis
    of external factors is not performed. At least not as extensively as a PEST analysis. So you
    might miss out on external factors that can benefit your project so a better approach would be
    to perform an extensive PEST analysis and use that finding in the opportunities and threats
    section in the SWOT analysis.</p>
<p>It is best practice to do the PEST analysis and include the results in SWOT analysis.</p>
