    <h2>Economic Problems Facing the Philippines</h2>

    <h3>Historical Economic Troubles</h3>
    <p>The Philippines has a history of economic challenges, including periods of significant growth
        followed by struggles to sustain that growth. Structural issues such as reliance on
        traditional export earnings, high investment costs, and a lack of sustained economic
        development have hindered the country's progress. Addressing these historical economic
        troubles requires long-term planning, structural reforms, and targeted policies to promote
        sustainable growth.</p>

    <h3>Persistent Challenges</h3>
    <p>Inequality, poverty, inadequate educational outcomes, limited healthcare access, and
        insufficient foreign direct investment continue to pose challenges for the Philippines. The
        country faces difficulties in attracting job-creating foreign direct investment compared to
        other ASEAN economies, impacting job creation and overall economic growth. Addressing these
        persistent challenges requires a comprehensive approach that addresses structural weaknesses
        and promotes inclusive growth.</p>

    <h3>Human Development Deficits</h3>
    <p>The Philippines grapples with human development deficits that affect the well-being of its
        population. Issues such as low educational outcomes and limited healthcare access contribute
        to challenges in human capital development. Efforts to improve educational quality, enhance
        healthcare services, and address disparities in access to essential services are crucial for
        addressing human development deficits in the country.</p>

    <h3>Poverty</h3>
    <p>Poverty remains a significant issue in the Philippines, driven by various factors such as low
        economic growth, weak employment generation, underdeveloped agriculture sector, high
        population growth, inequality, and exposure to risks like natural disasters. Despite efforts
        to reduce poverty through social programs and initiatives, progress has been slow and
        uneven. Addressing poverty requires a multi-dimensional approach that focuses on sustainable
        economic growth, social protection measures, and targeted interventions to uplift vulnerable
        populations.</p>

    <h3>Governance Challenges</h3>
    <p>Governance and institutional constraints present challenges to poverty reduction efforts in
        the Philippines. Weak local government capacity for implementing poverty reduction programs,
        deficiencies in targeting poverty programs effectively, resource gaps for poverty reduction
        initiatives, and the need for comprehensive responses to address multidimensional aspects of
        poverty are critical governance challenges that need to be addressed. Strengthening
        governance structures, enhancing transparency and accountability, and improving coordination
        among government agencies are essential for overcoming governance challenges in poverty
        reduction efforts.</p>

    <h3>Economic Recovery Efforts</h3>
    <p>The Philippine government has been implementing various economic recovery initiatives to
        address these challenges comprehensively. Reforms in education, healthcare, social
        protection, job creation, infrastructure investments through programs like 'Build Better
        More,' and a focus on enhancing human capital investments through laws providing free
        tertiary education and strengthening social protection mechanisms are part of the
        government's efforts to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development. These
        initiatives aim to address key economic problems while fostering resilience and improving
        the well-being of all Filipinos.</p>
