    <article class="card">
        <p>A financial plan is a comprehensive evaluation of an investor's current and future
            financial state by using currently known variables to predict future cash flows, asset
            values, and withdrawal plans. Most individuals work in conjunction with a financial
            planner and use current net worth, tax liabilities, asset allocation, and future
            retirement and estate plans in developing financial plans.</p>
        <p>These metrics are used along with estimates of asset growth to determine if a person's
            financial goals can be met in the future, or what steps need to be taken to ensure that
            they are.</p>
        <p>Financial planning is a process that a person goes through to determine where they are
            now (financially), identify their financial goals, and then determine how they will get
            to their goals. The components of a financial plan vary according to an individual's
            situation, but usually include retirement, investment, insurance, and estate
            planning.</p>
        <p>Financial planning is important because it helps ensure that a person's income will be
            enough to cover their future expenses. This includes both short-term expenses like
            housing, food, and utilities, as well as long-term expenses like healthcare and
            retirement.</p>
        <p>It can also help people avoid financial pitfalls, like overspending or not saving enough
            for retirement. By creating a financial plan, individuals can make informed decisions
            about their money and take steps to improve their financial situation.</p>

        <p class="card-content">Financial planning is an essential tool for individuals and
            businesses to achieve their financial goals. It involves creating a roadmap for managing

        <h4>Here are some of the uses and benefits of financial planning:</h4>
        <p class="card-content">Achieving Financial Goals: Financial planning helps individuals and
            businesses identify their short-term and long-term financial goals and create a plan to
            achieve them. This could include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off debt,
            or planning for retirement.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Managing Risks: Financial planning helps individuals and businesses
            manage risks by identifying potential risks and creating a plan to mitigate them. This
            could include purchasing insurance, diversifying investments, or creating an emergency
            fund.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Budgeting: Financial planning involves creating a budget to manage
            expenses and ensure that income is being used effectively. This can help individuals and
            businesses avoid overspending and ensure that they are saving enough money.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Investment Planning: Financial planning involves creating an
            investment plan that aligns with an individual's or business's financial goals and risk
            tolerance. This could include selecting investments, creating a diversified portfolio,
            and monitoring performance.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Retirement Planning: Financial planning is essential for retirement
            planning, as it involves creating a plan to ensure that individuals have enough income
            to support themselves in retirement. This could include saving in a retirement account,
            creating a diversified investment portfolio, and planning for healthcare expenses.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Tax Planning: Financial planning involves creating a tax plan to
            minimize taxes and ensure that individuals and businesses are taking advantage of any
            available tax benefits.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Estate Planning: Financial planning involves creating an estate plan
            to ensure that an individual's assets are distributed according to their wishes after
            they pass away. This could include creating a will, establishing trusts, and designating
            beneficiaries.</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Example of Financial Planning Process</h2>
        <p class="card-content">Set Clear Financial Goals: John, a 30-year-old software engineer,
            has decided to buy his own house. He estimates that he’ll need $20,000 for a 20% down
            payment in 5 years. This is his primary financial goal.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Create a Budget: John earns $3,000 per month after tax from his job.
            He calculates his necessary expenses which include $1,000 for rent, $500 for food, $300
            for utilities, $100 for transportation, and $100 for health insurance, totaling to
            $2,000 per month. This leaves him with $1,000 for savings and discretionary
            spending.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Establish an Emergency Fund: Before starting to save for his down
            payment, John decides to first save up 3 months’ worth of expenses ($6,000) as an
            emergency fund. This fund acts as a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses
            or loss of income.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Save for the Goal: After establishing his emergency fund, John
            starts saving $500 per month towards his down payment. He puts this money into a
            high-yield savings account where it earns an annual interest rate of 2%. This allows his
            savings to grow faster than a regular savings account.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Invest: John decides to invest the remaining $500 in a diversified
            portfolio of stocks and bonds. He chooses a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds to balance
            growth and risk. He uses a robo-advisor to manage his investments and adjust the
            portfolio based on market conditions.</p>
        <p class="card-content">Monitor and Adjust: John reviews his financial plan annually. He
            checks his budget, savings, and investments to see if they are on track to meet his
            goal. If his income increases, he may decide to save more each month. If his expenses
            increase, he may need to adjust his budget or savings.</p>
