<h2>PLANNING</h2>

<p><strong>Let’s Hit the Springboard</strong></p>
<p>If plan “A” didn’t work, there are still 25 letters more in the alphabet. Before you end up in
    this school, have you considered other schools, universities or colleges to move up to senior
    high? At this point have you decided which course you would take in college? How do you see
    yourself 5 to 10 years from now?</p>
<p>According to Benjamin, "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail". Planning is the process
    of deciding in advance what to do, be done, where, how and whom it is to be done. It is a
    process that involves anticipation of future course of action. In this lesson, we will discuss
    the types of plan, planning and problem solving and decision making.</p>

<p>Planning is the first and foremost function of management. It is an intellectual process of
    thinking resorted to decide a course of action which helps achieve the predetermined objectives
    of the organization in future. It is also the fundamental function of management and all other
    function like organizing, staffing, directing and controlling must reflect planning function of
    management. It is most important for higher level but this function is performed by every
    manager at their respective jobs. While planning, the manager projects a course of action for
    the future aimed at achieving desired results for the enterprise as a whole and each department
    within it.</p>

<p>It deals with future involves forecasting. A manager does not plan about the past but he is
    guided by the post-performance in the process of planning it requires projecting future
    activities at the organization. So, we can say that planning is forecasting and deciding in
    advance a course of action to be followed in the future.</p>

<p>According to Terry, “Planning is the selecting and relating of facts and the making and using of
    assumptions regarding the future in the visualization and formulation of proposed activities
    believed necessary to achieve desired results.”</p>

<p>H. Fayol says, “Planning is deciding the best alternatives among others to perform different
    managerial operations in order to achieve the predetermined goals.”</p>

<p><strong>The Essential nature or characteristics of planning can be highlighted by the following
    points:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Primary of Planning</strong> – The functions of management include planning,
        organizing, staffing, directing and controlling. It is the most basic management function.
        As a matter of fact, all other functions of management largely depend upon planning. For
        example, control cannot exist without planning. Organization is also setup with a plan &
        objectives in mind. Planning is therefore the primary function of Management.
    </li>
    <li><strong>An intellectual activity</strong> – Planning involves choosing the proper course of
        action from among alternatives & calls for decision-making which is an intellectual process.
        Change in environment brings opportunities and involved risk as well. It is the task of
        planner to take advantage of opportunities and minimize the risk.
    </li>
    <li><strong>A continuous function</strong> – Management is a dynamic process and planning as its
        function cannot be an exception to it. Moreover, as plans beget a number of sub-plans and
        since plans have to be revised in the light of changing environment, planning becomes a
        continuous function of Management.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Planning is flexible</strong> – While planning, any one of the available
        alternatives is selected. Planning selects the best alternatives based on certain
        assumptions. There is a possibility of dead log in the functions of management. Planning has
        one more alternative to suit future situations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>For all managerial functions</strong> – Planning is a pervasive function of
        management. It is found at all levels and all departments of an organization. Top management
        looks after strategic planning. It involves choosing the future course of action from among
        alternatives.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>The 4 Types of Plans</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Operational Planning</strong></li>
    <p>"Operational plans are about how things need to happen," motivational leadership speaker Mack
        Story said at LinkedIn. "Guidelines of how to accomplish the mission are set." This type of
        planning typically describes the day-to-day running of the company. Operational plans are
        often described as single use plans or ongoing plans. Single use plans are created for
        events and activities with a single occurrence (such as a single marketing campaign).
        Ongoing plans include policies for approaching problems, rules for specific regulations and
        procedures for a step by step process for accomplishing particular objectives.</p>

    <li><strong>Strategic Planning</strong></li>
    <p>"Strategic plans are all about why things need to happen," Story said. "Its big picture,
        long-term thinking. It starts at the highest level with defining a mission and casting a
        vision." Strategic planning includes a high-level overview of the entire business. It’s the
        foundational basis of the organization and will dictate long-term decisions. The scope of
        strategic planning can be anywhere from the next two years to the next 10 years. Important
        components of a strategic plan are vision, mission and values.</p>

    <li><strong>Tactical Planning</strong></li>
    <p>"Tactical plans are about what is going to happen," Story said. "Basically at the tactical
        level, there are many focused, specific, and short-term plans, where the actual work is
        being done, that support the high-level strategic plans." Tactical planning supports
        strategic planning. It includes tactics that the organization plans to use to achieve what’s
        outlined in the strategic plan. Often, the scope is less than one year and breaks down the
        strategic plan into actionable chunks. Tactical planning is different from operational
        planning in that tactical plans ask specific questions about what needs to happen to
        accomplish a strategic goal; operational plans ask how the organization will generally do
        something to accomplish the company’s mission.</p>

    <li><strong>Contingency Planning</strong></li>
    <p>Contingency plans are made when something unexpected happens or when something needs to be
        changed. Business experts sometimes refer to these plans as a special type of planning.
        Contingency planning can be helpful in circumstances that call for a change. Although
        managers should anticipate changes when engaged in any of the primary types of planning,
        contingency planning is essential in moments when changes can’t be foreseen. As the business
        world becomes more complicated, contingency planning becomes more important to engage in and
        understand.</p>
