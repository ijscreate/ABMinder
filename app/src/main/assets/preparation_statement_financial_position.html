    <h2>Preparation of Statement of Financial Position</h2>
    <p>In preparing the SFP of a single proprietorship, the following steps must be applied:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The SFP must have a heading comprising the name of the business, title of the report,
            and date covered by the report.
        </li>
        <li>Its left margin is usually subdivided into two; extreme margin for major Subheadings
            (e.g., current assets; plant, property, and equipment; other noncurrent assets; current
            liabilities; noncurrent liabilities; and owner’s equity) and inner margin for specific
            account titles.
        </li>
        <li>At the right margin, the extreme money column is also for major subheading while the
            inner margin is for specific accounts.
        </li>
        <li>A double rule is placed under total assets and total liabilities and owner’s equity. As
            expressed in the accounting equation, asset must equal liabilities and owner’s equity.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example of Preparing the SFP of a Single Proprietorship:</h2>
    <p>Let's assume a single proprietorship, "John's Bike Shop," with the following information:</p>

    <p>The Statement of Financial Position (SFP) summarizes the financial position of a business at a specific point in time, typically the end of a reporting period. It provides insights into the company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity, presenting a snapshot of what the business owns and owes. The SFP is a crucial financial statement used by investors, creditors, and other stakeholders to assess the financial health and performance of the business.</p>
