    <h2>Product Strategy</h2>

    <p>Product strategy is a crucial aspect of marketing, as it forms the foundation of the
        marketing mix. Marketers must first determine the product or service they will offer before
        they can plan a distribution system or set a price. The term "product" in marketing refers
        to goods, services, or even ideas that fulfill a customer's needs or desires.</p>

    <h2>Goods and Services</h2>
    <p>Goods can be divided into business goods or consumer goods. Examples of consumer goods
        include tires, MP3 players, and clothing. Services can be consumer services or professional
        services. Examples include lawn care, hair styling, engineering, accounting, or
        consultancy.</p>

    <h2>Marketing and Industry Viability</h2>
    <p>Marketers often use marketing to improve the long-term viability of their industries, such as
        the avocado or milk industry, by running advertising spots and posting social media messages
        to encourage consumers to view their industries favorably.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Product Strategy</h2>
    <p>Creating a product strategy involves choosing a brand name, packaging, colors, a warranty,
        accessories, and a service program. Marketers view products in a much larger context than is
        often thought, including not only the item itself but also the brand name and the company
        image.</p>

    <h2>Product Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>Marketers must also consider the product's lifecycle, which includes the introduction,
        growth, maturity, and decline stages. Each stage requires a different marketing approach to
        maximize the product's success.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Product Strategies</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of product strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Differentiation Strategy: This strategy focuses on making the product unique compared to
            existing solutions in the market.
        </li>
        <li>Quality Strategy: Quality and reliability matter a lot in B2B software, as
            business-critical functions rely on them.
        </li>
        <li>Cost Strategy: Making a good yet affordable product is the idea behind the cost
            strategy.
        </li>
        <li>Focus Strategy: Product vendors operating in the B2B sphere can gain much using a focus
            strategy.
        </li>
        <li>Pioneer Strategy: Providing quality without considering pricing is a high-risk,
            high-reward strategy.
        </li>
        <li>Niche Strategy: While focus strategy narrows the field of competition, niche strategies
            allow product managers to focus on narrowing the features to address the specific needs
            of a small group.
        </li>
        <li>Challenger Strategy: This global product strategy example is similar to competing on
            price strategy but also encompasses competing on features.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Defining a Product Strategy</h2>
    <p>Creating a product strategy involves defining the product vision, framework, and roadmap. By
        having a clear product strategy, businesses can prioritize features and timetables, meet
        critical customer needs, and ultimately achieve their business goals.</p>
