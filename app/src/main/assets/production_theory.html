    <h2>Production Theory</h2>
    <p>Production refers to the use of economic resources to create goods and services that will be
        used to satisfy human wants. In this chapter, we will focus on the behavior of the producer
        in an attempt to maximize output. The theory of production is an analysis of the
        input-output relationship. The term input refers to the resources used to produce goods and
        services. Output refers to the product created as a result of the combination of input in
        the production process.</p>
    <p>The production function is an equation showing the maximum output of a commodity that a firm
        can produce per period of time with each set of input. Input and output are measured in
        physical rather than monetary units: Output = f (input)</p>
    <p>The production function represented in the equation: O = f (i), where O stands for output and
        I stands for input. To be more specific, output depends on the quantity of land, labor, and
        capital available. Thus: O = f (Ld, Lb, C)</p>
    <p>The production function contains the functional relationship between output and the basic
        factors of land, labor, and capital. These basic factors complement each other as they are
        used in the production of goods and services.</p>
    <p>Output produced is measured in three forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total Product (TP) is the combined production of several units of a given input.</li>
        <li>Marginal Product (MP) is the additional output produced by an additional unit of the
            input and is equal to ‚àÜùëáùëÉ / ‚àÜi.
        </li>
        <li>Average Product (AP) refers to the average contribution per unit of input and is equal
            to TP / i.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us illustrate the values of the three forms of output by studying the following table.
        Let us assume that the variable input in labor measured in man hours and is combined with
        fixed units of capital and land.</p>

    <p>Let us study the behavior of the different product values as the quantity of labor input
        increases. Initially, we see that the addition and additional labor input leads to a
        proportionately greater increase in total product or output (TP). This result in increasing
        values of MP and AP and corresponds to labor input from 1 to 4. As more input of labor are
        added, Total Product continues to increase but already at a decreasing rate. This happens
        from the 5th to the 9th input of labor. Here, the Marginal Product and Average Product
        already show decreasing values. Upon the addition of the 10th input of labor, the Marginal
        Product is now negative.</p>
    <p>The stage where Total Product is increasing at a fast rate is the stage of increasing
        returns. Here, Marginal Product and Average Product are both increasing.</p>
    <p>When Total Product is increasing at a slower rate and Marginal Product and Average Product
        are both decreasing, we have the stage of diminishing returns.</p>
    <p>When Total Product decreases and as a result Marginal Product is negative, we enter the stage
        of negative returns.</p>
    <p>The production behavior above leads us to the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns. It is in
        reference to the diminishing values of MP. The Law states that additional output starts to
        diminish at a certain point as additional units of the variable input are combined with one
        or more fixed input. The reason for this behavior can be traced to the constraints faced
        because of the fixed resources that are used in complement with the variable input, which in
        this case, is labor.</p>
