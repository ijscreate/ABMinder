    <h2>Sample Question:</h2>

    <p>A bakery sells cupcakes for $3 each and incurs a production cost of $1.50 per cupcake. Their monthly revenue is $18,000. What is their monthly net profit margin?</p>

    <h3>Solution:</h3>

    <p><strong>Net Income = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = $18,000 - ($1.50/cupcake * 6,000 cupcakes) = $6,000</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) * 100% = ($6,000 / $18,000) * 100% = 33.33%</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Don't just calculate margins, analyze them! Explore reasons behind fluctuations, identify areas for improvement, and use your profit margin insights to make strategic decisions that propel your business, your wallet, or your shopping cart towards success!</p>
