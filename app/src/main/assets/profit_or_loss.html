    <h2>Profit or Loss</h2>
    <p>Profit or loss is calculated by comparing the total revenue of a business with its total
        expenses. The revenue represents the money earned by the business from its operations, while
        the expenses refer to the costs incurred in generating the revenue.</p>
    <p>To calculate the profit or loss, the following formula is used:</p>
    <p><strong>Profit or Loss = Total Revenue - Total Expenses</strong></p>
    <p>If the result is positive, it indicates a profit, while a negative result signifies a
        loss.</p>
    <p>The profit or loss is reported in a financial statement called the profit and loss statement
        or P&L statement. This statement summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses of a business
        over a specific period, typically a month, quarter, or year.</p>
    <p>The P&L statement includes various types of revenues, such as sales revenue, interest
        revenue, and rental income. Similarly, it includes different types of expenses, such as cost
        of goods sold (COGS), selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), depreciation and
        amortization, and interest expenses.</p>
    <p>To calculate the profit or loss, the first step is to determine the total revenue by adding
        up all the revenue sources. The next step is to calculate the total expenses by adding up
        all the expense categories. Finally, the profit or loss is calculated by subtracting the
        total expenses from the total revenue.</p>
    <p>The profit or loss is a critical metric for evaluating the financial health of a business. A
        positive profit indicates that the business is generating more revenue than it is spending,
        while a negative profit suggests that the business is not profitable and may need to cut
        costs or increase revenue to remain viable.</p>

        <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
        <p>For example, let's say a service business in the Philippines has the following financial
            information for the year ended December 31, 2023, in Philippine Peso (PHP):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total income: PHP 1,000,000</li>
            <li>Total expenses: PHP 800,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To calculate the net profit or net income, we would subtract the total expenses from the
            total income:</p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = Total income - Total expenses</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = PHP 1,000,000 - PHP 800,000</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = PHP 200,000</strong></p>
        <p>Therefore, the service business has a net profit or net income of PHP 200,000 for the
            year ended December 31, 2023.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if the total expenses exceed the total income, the resulting amount
            would be a net loss. For example, if the total expenses were PHP 1,200,000 instead of
            PHP 800,000, the net profit or net income would be:</p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = Total income - Total expenses</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = PHP 1,000,000 - PHP 1,200,000</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Net profit or net income = -PHP 200,000</strong></p>
        <p>Therefore, the service business has a net loss of PHP 200,000 for the year ended December
            31, 2023.</p>
