<section>
    <h3>What is a Ratio?</h3>
    <p>A <strong>ratio</strong> shows the relative sizes of two or more numbers or values. Ratios
        are used to compare
        quantities in various contexts such as shapes, recipes, classrooms, or populations between
        cities.</p>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/ratio.png" alt="ratio"
         style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>Ratios can be represented in different ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a colon ":" (e.g., a <code>2:3</code> ratio)</li>
        <li>With the word "to" (e.g., a ratio of <code>2 to 3</code>)</li>
        <li>As a fraction (e.g., <code>2/3</code>)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These all express the same ratio relationship, where the first value is being compared
        relative to the second
        value. Ratios help establish relationships and proportionality between the values.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Using Ratios</h3>
    <p>     Ratios are useful in practical areas like cooking/baking recipes, map/model scaling,
        population density,
        probability, and financial analysis. They allow relative comparisons even when quantities
        are different or
        measured in different units, simplifying comparisons in a proportional way.</p>
    <p>     Ratios are used in many different fields, including mathematics, science, engineering, and
        business. In mathematics, ratios are used to solve problems involving proportions and rates.
        In science, ratios are used to compare the sizes of different objects or to measure the
        concentration of substances. In engineering, ratios are used to design structures and
        machines. In business, ratios are used to analyze financial statements and to make
        investment decisions.</p>
    <p>     To use ratios effectively, it is important to understand what they mean and how they are
        calculated. You should also be aware of the limitations of ratios and use them in
        conjunction with other data to get a complete picture of the situation you are analyzing.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Equivalent Ratios</h3>
    <p>Ratios that represent the same comparison using different numbers are called equivalent
        ratios. You can generate
        equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing the numbers in a ratio by the same non-zero
        number or value.</p>
    <p>To understand equivalent ratios, let's consider an example. Suppose you have a recipe that
        calls for 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar. This means that the ratio of flour to sugar is
        2:1. If you want to make a larger batch of the recipe, you can maintain the same ratio by
        using 4 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar, or 6 cups of flour and 3 cups of sugar, and so
        on. All of these ratios (2:1, 4:2, 6:3) are equivalent because they represent the same
        proportion of flour to sugar.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Simplifying Ratios</h3>
    <p>Ratios can be simplified by dividing each component by their greatest common factor, making
        the numbers usually
        smaller and easier to work with. For example, <code>16:24</code> could be simplified to
        <code>2:3</code>.</p>
    <p>Simplifying ratio is a mathematical concept used to reduce a complex ratio to its simplest
        form. It involves dividing both the numerator and denominator of a ratio by the greatest
        common factor (GCF) between them. The GCF is the largest number that divides both the
        numerator and denominator without leaving a remainder.</p>
    <p>Simplifying ratios is useful in various mathematical operations, such as comparing fractions,
        solving proportions, and converting between different units of measurement. It helps to
        eliminate unnecessary complexity and allows for easier calculations and analysis.</p>
    <p>Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to simplify a ratio:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.</li>
        <li>Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.</li>
        <li>The resulting ratio is the simplified form.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, to simplify the ratio 24:36, the GCF of 24 and 36 is 12. Dividing both the
        numerator and denominator by 12 gives the simplified ratio of 2:3.</p>
    <i>
    <p>Simplifying ratios is a fundamental skill in mathematics that helps to simplify calculations
        and make mathematical concepts more understandable.</p>
    </i>

    <h3>Using Proportions with Ratios</h3>
    <p>A proportion states that two ratios are equivalent, forming equal fraction relationships.
        Proportions utilizing
        ratios are extremely useful for converting measurements, scaling between quantities,
        determining missing
        lengths, comparing growth rates, calculating probability outcomes, and more.</p>
    <p>A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. For example, the
        proportion 3:4 = 6:8 is true because both ratios are equal to 3/4. Proportions can be used
        to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the missing term in a proportion or
        determining whether two shapes are similar.</p>
