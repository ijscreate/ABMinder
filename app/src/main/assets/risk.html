    <h3>Risk in Investing</h3>
    <p>Risk in investing refers to the chance that an investment's actual returns will differ from
        the expected returns. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original
        investment. It is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes, and
        standard deviation is a common metric associated with risk. Risk can come in various ways,
        and investors need to be compensated for taking on additional risk. The relationship between
        risk and return is fundamental in finance, with greater risk associated with greater
        potential returns.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some key points about risk in investing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Risk is the possibility of losing money or not achieving the expected return on
            investment.
        </li>
        <li>All investments carry some level of risk, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and
            real estate.
        </li>
        <li>Different types of risk include market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, inflation
            risk, and liquidity risk.
        </li>
        <li>Investors can manage risk through diversification, asset allocation, and risk
            assessment.
        </li>
        <li>It's important for investors to understand their risk tolerance and investment
            objectives before making investment decisions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are two main categories of investment risks: systematic risk and unsystematic risk.
        Systematic risks, also known as market risks, are risks that can affect an entire economic
        market or a large percentage of the total market. Examples include political risk,
        macroeconomic risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk,
        country risk, and sociopolitical risk. Systematic risks cannot be easily mitigated through
        portfolio diversification.</p>
    <p>Unsystematic risk, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk
        that only affects an industry or a particular company. Examples include a change in
        management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a
        new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a
        company. Investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a
        variety of assets.</p>

    <div class="risk-item"><h4>Additional Types of Financial Risk:</h4>
        <p>In addition to systematic and unsystematic risks, there are several specific types of
            financial risk, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Risk:</strong> Business risk refers to the basic viability of a
                business, including its ability to generate revenue, manage costs, and maintain
                profitability. Business risk can arise from a variety of factors, such as changes in
                consumer demand, increased competition, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory
                changes.
            <li><strong>Credit or Default Risk:</strong> Credit or default risk is the risk that a
                borrower will be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on its debt
                obligations. This risk can arise from a variety of factors, such as a decline in the
                borrower's creditworthiness, a decline in the value of the collateral securing the
                debt, or a decline in the overall economy.
            <li><strong>Country Risk:</strong> Country risk refers to the risk that a country won't
                be able to honor its financial commitments, such as its debt obligations. This risk
                can arise from a variety of factors, such as political instability, economic
                instability, or a decline in the value of the country's currency.
            <li><strong>Foreign-Exchange Risk:</strong> Foreign-exchange risk applies to all
                financial instruments that are in a currency other than your domestic currency. This
                risk arises from changes in exchange rates, which can affect the value of foreign
                investments and the cost of foreign transactions.
            <li><strong>Interest Rate Risk:</strong> Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in
                interest rates will affect the value of an investment. This risk can arise from a
                variety of factors, such as changes in monetary policy, changes in the overall
                economy, or changes in investor sentiment.
            <li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> Political risk is the risk that political events or
                changes in government policy will affect the value of an investment. This risk can
                arise from a variety of factors, such as changes in tax policy, changes in
                regulatory policy, or political instability.
            <li><strong>Counterparty Risk:</strong> Counterparty risk is the risk that a
                counterparty, such as a borrower or a trading partner, will fail to fulfill its
                obligations under a contract. This risk can arise from a variety of factors, such as
                financial instability, operational issues, or legal disputes.
            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Liquidity risk is the risk that an investor will
                not be able to sell an investment quickly enough to avoid a loss. This risk can
                arise from a variety of factors, such as a lack of buyers, a lack of market
                transparency, or a lack of market depth.
            <li><strong>Model Risk:</strong> Model risk is the risk that a financial model used to
                value an investment or to make investment decisions is incorrect or incomplete. This
                risk can arise from a variety of factors, such as incorrect assumptions, inadequate
                data, or errors in the model's design or implementation.
        </ul>

    <div class="diversification">
        <h3>Diversification: A Risk Management Strategy</h3>
        <p>Diversification is a risk management strategy that involves spreading investments across
            various assets or asset classes to reduce exposure to any single asset or risk. The goal
            of diversification is to create a portfolio that, on average, yields higher long-term
            returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.</p>

        <p>For example, consider an investor who has a portfolio consisting solely of stocks in the
            technology sector. While this investor may have the potential for high returns, they are
            also exposed to significant risk if the technology sector experiences a downturn. To
            mitigate this risk, the investor could diversify their portfolio by adding assets from
            other sectors, such as healthcare, finance, or consumer goods.</p>

        <p>Another way to diversify is by investing in assets that have a low correlation with each
            other. For instance, when the value of stocks decreases, the value of bonds may
            increase, and vice versa. By investing in both stocks and bonds, an investor can reduce
            the overall risk of their portfolio.</p>

        <p>Diversification can also be achieved by investing in assets with different risk profiles.
            For example, an investor could invest in a mix of both growth stocks and value stocks.
            Growth stocks tend to be more risky, while value stocks tend to be more stable. By
            investing in both, an investor can capitalize on the future potential of some companies
            while also recognizing the existing benefits of others.</p>

    <div class="risk-example">
        <h3>Example of Risk in Investment</h3>
        <p>Here’s an example of risk in investment:</p>
        <p>Let’s say you decide to invest in a startup company, XYZ Tech, because you believe it has
            a promising future. You buy 1000 shares at PHP 1120.8 each (equivalent to $20), for a
            total investment of PHP 1,120,800.</p>
        <p>However, after a year, the company’s product fails to gain traction in the market and the
            company starts to struggle financially. As a result, the stock price falls to PHP 560.4
            per share (equivalent to $10). Your investment is now worth only PHP 560,400, which
            means you’ve lost 50% of your initial investment.</p>
        <p>This example illustrates the risk of investing in stocks, particularly those of smaller,
            less-established companies. While the potential for high returns is there, the risk of
            losing a significant portion, or even all, of your investment is also present. This is
            why diversification, or spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes and
            sectors, is often recommended as a way to manage risk.</p>
