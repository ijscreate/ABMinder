<head><h2>Salaries, Wages, Income, and Benefits</h2></head>

<section>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Salaries, wages, income, and benefits are important components of compensation for
        employees. Here's a breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salary:</strong> A fixed amount of money paid on an annual basis to skilled
            and professional workers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wage:</strong> A variable amount of money paid based on the amount of work
            done or hours spent, typically to semi-skilled or unskilled workers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> The total amount of money earned from various sources,
            including active income and passive income.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Additional compensation or rewards provided by employers
            to employees, beyond basic salary or wage.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Types of Earners:</strong> There are three types of earners: salary earners,
            wage earners, and
            income earners. Salary earners receive a fixed amount regardless of the number of hours
            worked. Wage earners are paid based on actual hours worked. Income earners earn from
            various sources beyond regular employment.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section>
    <h3>Salary</h3>
    <p>Salary is a fixed amount of money that an individual receives for the work done on an
        annual basis. It is usually paid monthly or bi-monthly, and does not change based on
        performance. Salaries are typically given to skilled and professional workers.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Ms. Ana's Salary Calculation</h4>
        <p>Ms. Ana is a public school teacher in Quezon City. She has a fixed gross annual salary of
            Php480,000.</p>
        <p><strong>How much is her salary rate per month?</strong></p>
        <p>Monthly Salary Rate = Php480,000 / 12 months = Php40,000 per month</p>
        <p>So, Ms. Ana has a fixed gross salary rate of Php40,000 per month.</p>
        <p><strong>In the Philippines, the usual practice of salary distribution is semi-monthly.
            How much is the per semi-monthly salary rate of Ms. Ana?</strong></p>
        <p>Semi-Monthly Salary Rate = Php40,000 / 2 = Php20,000 per semi-month</p>
        <p>So, Ms. Ana has a salary rate of Php20,000 per semi-month.</p>
        <p><strong>If Ms. Ana works during the summer vacation for special projects, will she
            receive additional compensation for this?</strong></p>
        <p>As a public school teacher, Ms. Ana may receive additional compensation for working
            during the summer vacation if it is part of a special project or program. The amount
            would depend on the specific terms of the project or program. However, if she is working
            beyond her regular duties without being part of a special project, she may not receive
            additional compensation as her salary is fixed annually.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <h4>Mr. Carlos's Salary Calculation</h4>
        <p>Let’s consider another scenario involving a software engineer in the Philippines:</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlos is a software engineer working for a private company in Makati. He has a fixed
            gross annual salary of Php1,200,000.</p>
        <p><strong>How much is his salary rate per month?</strong></p>
        <p>Monthly Salary Rate = Php1,200,000 / 12 months = Php100,000 per month</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Carlos has a fixed gross salary rate of Php100,000 per month.</p>
        <p><strong>In the Philippines, the usual practice of salary distribution is semi-monthly.
            How much is the per semi-monthly salary rate of Mr. Carlos?</strong></p>
        <p>Semi-Monthly Salary Rate = Php100,000 / 2 = Php50,000 per semi-month</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Carlos has a salary rate of Php50,000 per semi-month.</p>
        <p><strong>If Mr. Carlos receives a year-end bonus equivalent to one month’s salary, how
            much is his total annual income?</strong></p>
        <p>Year-End Bonus = Php100,000</p>
        <p>Total Annual Income = Annual Salary + Year-End Bonus = Php1,200,000 + Php100,000 =
            Php1,300,000</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Carlos’s total annual income, including his year-end bonus, is Php1,300,000.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Wage</h3>
    <p>Wage is a variable amount of money paid based on the amount of work done or hours spent.
        It is usually paid daily or weekly and can change based on the quantity or quality of
        work done.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <h4>Mr. Juan's Wage Calculation</h4>
        <p>Let’s consider another scenario involving a factory worker in the Philippines:</p>
        <p>Mr. Juan is a factory worker in a private company in Manila. He earns a wage based on the
            number of hours he works. His hourly wage is Php200.</p>
        <p><strong>How much does Mr. Juan earn in a day if he works for 8 hours?</strong></p>
        <p>Daily Wage = Php200 * 8 hours = Php1,600 per day</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Juan earns Php1,600 per day.</p>
        <p><strong>How much does Mr. Juan earn in a month if he works 26 days?</strong></p>
        <p>Monthly Wage = Php1,600 * 26 days = Php41,600 per month</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Juan earns Php41,600 per month.</p>
        <p><strong>If Mr. Juan works overtime for 2 hours a day for 5 days in a month, how much
            additional pay will he receive?</strong></p>
        <p>In the Philippines, the overtime pay is usually 125% of the regular hourly rate.</p>
        <p>Overtime Pay = 1.25 * Php200 * 2 hours * 5 days = Php2,500</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Juan will receive an additional Php2,500 for his overtime work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h4>Mr. Pedro's Wage Calculation</h4>
        <p>Now let's calculate the earnings of Mr. Pedro, a construction worker in Davao City:</p>
        <p>Mr. Pedro earns a wage based on the number of hours he works, with an hourly rate of
            Php150.</p>
        <p><strong>How much does Mr. Pedro earn in a day if he works for 10 hours?</strong></p>
        <p>Daily Wage = Php150 * 10 hours = Php1,500 per day</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Pedro earns Php1,500 per day.</p>
        <p><strong>How much does Mr. Pedro earn in a week if he works 6 days?</strong></p>
        <p>Weekly Wage = Php1,500 * 6 days = Php9,000 per week</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Pedro earns Php9,000 per week.</p>
        <p><strong>If Mr. Pedro works on a Sunday, which is usually his day off, how much additional
            pay will he receive?</strong></p>
        <p>In the Philippines, the pay for work done on a rest day, Sunday or a holiday is usually
            130% of the regular hourly rate.</p>
        <p>Rest Day Pay = 1.30 * Php150 * 10 hours = Php1,950</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Pedro will receive an additional Php1,950 for working on his rest day.</p>

    <h3>Income</h3>
    <p>Income refers to the money that an individual or business receives in exchange for providing
        a good or service or through investing capital. It is consumed by individuals and businesses
        to fund their day-to-day operations.</p>
    <p>Income can come from various sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Employment Income:</strong> This is the income that individuals receive from
            their job or profession. For example, a software engineer working for a tech company
            receives a monthly salary. This salary is the engineer’s employment income.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Income:</strong> This is the income that a business generates from its
            operations. For example, a grocery store owner sells goods to customers. The money
            received from selling these goods is the store’s business income.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Investment Income:</strong> This is the income that individuals or businesses
            earn from their investments. For example, if you buy stocks of a company and the company
            pays dividends, those dividends are your investment income.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Passive Income:</strong> This is the income that individuals receive regularly
            with little effort required to maintain it. For example, income from renting out a
            property or earning royalties from a book published.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Other Income:</strong> This includes all other forms of income that do not fall
            into the above categories. For example, winnings from a lottery or game show would be
            considered other income.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, different types of income can be taxed differently, and it’s important to
        understand these differences when filing your taxes.</p>

    <h3>Income Tax in the Philippines</h3>
    <p>Income tax in the Philippines is a tax imposed by the government on the income earned by
        individuals and corporations. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is the government agency
        responsible for collecting taxes.</p>

    <h4>Individual Income Tax Rates</h4>
    <p>For individuals, the income tax rates can range from 0% to 35% depending on your taxable
        income. Here are the important points related to the new income tax rates from
        2023 and in succeeding years:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Those earning an annual salary of Php250,000 or below will continue to be exempted from
            paying income tax.
        </li>
        <li>Those earning between Php250,000 and Php400,000 per year will be charged a lower income
            tax rate of 15% on the excess over Php250,000.
        </li>
        <li>Those with annual salaries from Php400,000 to Php800,000 will have withholding taxes of
            Php22,500 plus 20% of the excess over Php400,000.
        </li>
        <li>Salaried employees with annual incomes between Php800,000 and Php2 million will be
            charged a fixed amount of Php102,500 plus 25% on the excess over Php800,000.
        </li>
        <li>Those receiving salaries between Php2 million and Php8 million per year will be charged
            Php402,500 plus 30% of the excess over Php2 million.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, the highest income segment of employees with annual salaries of at least Php8
            million will pay Php2.2025 million plus 35% of the excess over Php8 million.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For corporations, the general income tax rate is 30%. However, for-profit
        educational institutions and hospitals enjoy a much lower rate of 10%</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Benefits are additional forms of compensation or rewards that employers offer to their
        employees, which go beyond the basic salary or wage. These benefits are provided to enhance
        the overall compensation package of employees and to attract, motivate, and retain talented
        individuals within the organization.</p>
    <p>There are various types of benefits that employers may offer to their employees,
        including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Employers may provide health insurance coverage to
            employees and their families, which helps cover medical expenses, hospitalization, and
            other healthcare costs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Retirement Plans:</strong> Employers may offer retirement plans, such as 401(k)
            or pension plans, to help employees save for their retirement years. These plans often
            involve employer contributions and may include matching contributions based on employee
            contributions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Paid Time Off:</strong> Paid time off benefits include vacation leave, sick
            leave, and holidays. These benefits allow employees to take time off from work for
            personal reasons, illness, or to celebrate holidays without losing their regular pay.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Life Insurance:</strong> Employers may offer life insurance coverage to
            employees, providing financial protection to their families in the event of the
            employee's death.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Disability Insurance:</strong> Disability insurance provides income replacement
            benefits to employees who are unable to work due to illness or injury. This benefit
            helps employees maintain their financial stability during periods of disability.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs):</strong> FSAs allow employees to set aside
            pre-tax dollars to pay for eligible healthcare expenses, such as medical and dental
            care, prescription medications, and dependent care expenses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tuition Assistance:</strong> Some employers offer tuition assistance programs to
            help employees further their education and skills development. These programs may
            reimburse employees for tuition costs or provide financial assistance for continuing
            education courses.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):</strong> EAPs offer employees access to
            counseling, mental health services, and other support programs to help them manage
            personal and work-related challenges.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Wellness Programs:</strong> Wellness programs promote employee health and
            well-being through initiatives such as fitness classes, health screenings, smoking
            cessation programs, and healthy lifestyle incentives.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commuter Benefits:</strong> Commuter benefits provide employees with tax-free
            funds to pay for eligible commuting expenses, such as public transportation, parking
            fees, and bicycle commuting expenses.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Philippine Occupational Wages and Minimum Wage Rates</h3>
    <p>Based on the latest Occupational Wages Survey (OWS) conducted by the Philippine Statistics
        Authority (PSA) in 2022, the overall average monthly wage rate of time-rated workers on a
        full-time basis across 193 monitored occupations in 72 selected industries was PHP 18,423.
        This represents an 11.7 percent increase from the average monthly wage rate of these workers
        in 2020, which stood at PHP 16,486, and a 1.7 percent increment from their average monthly
        wage rate in 2018, which was PHP 18,108.</p>
    <p>Among the highest-paying occupations in 2022 were aircraft pilots and related associate
        professionals in the Air Transport industry, commanding an average monthly wage rate of PHP
        135,363. Following closely were software developers in Information Service Activities, with
        an average monthly wage rate of PHP 70,595.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that the minimum wage rates in the Philippines vary by region,
        province, and industry sector. As of June 2020, the minimum wage for non-agricultural
        workers in Metro Manila was PHP 570, while it was PHP 537 for agricultural workers.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, besides salaries and wages, employees in the Philippines are entitled to various
        benefits. These include overtime pay, holiday pay, service incentive leave, parental leaves,
        13th-month pay, separation pay, health and insurance benefits, among others. The
        availability of these benefits depends on the employer's policies and compliance with labor
        laws.</p>
