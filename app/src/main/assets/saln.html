<h2>The Basics: Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN)</h2>

<h3>What is a SALN?</h3>

<p>SALN stands for Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth. It is a declaration of assets
    (i.e., land, vehicles, etc) and liabilities (i.e., loans, debts, etc), including business and
    financial interests, of an official/employee, of his or her spouse, and of his or her unmarried
    children under 18 years old still living in their parents’ households. The submission of a SALN
    is required by law under Article XI Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution and Section 8 of
    Republic Act No. 6713, the “Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and
    Employees.” It includes a waiver authorizing the Ombudsman or his authorized representatives to
    attain documents that may show assets, liabilities, net worth, business interests, and financial
    connections from all appropriate government agencies.</p>

<h3>Who Needs to File a SALN?</h3>

<p>The Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) is a required financial disclosure
    form for public officials and employees in the Philippines. It is mandatory for all public
    officials and employees, regardless of their status (regular or under temporary status), to file
    a SALN. <br>
    <br>
    The SALN is a financial statement that provides information about the assets, liabilities, and

        of lending money to the public official or employee.</li>

        the risk of investing in the business or individual.</li>
    <li>Creditors: Creditors, such as suppliers or service providers, use the SALN to assess the
        risk of extending credit to the public official or employee.</li>
    <li>The public: The public, including voters and citizens, use the SALN to assess the financial
        integrity and transparency of public officials and employees.</li>
