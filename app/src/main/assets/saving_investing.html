    <h2>Saving vs. Investing</h2>

    <h4>Saving</h4>
    <p>Saving involves setting money aside for future use, typically for emergencies or specific
        goals. It is characterized by low risk, easy access, and minimal taxes. Savings accounts or
        bonds are common saving options that offer security but lower returns compared to
        investments.</p>

    <h4>Investing</h4>
    <p>Investing entails using resources, such as money, with the expectation of generating
        increased income or growing the value of the investment. Investments, like stocks, bonds, or
        mutual funds, are selected to achieve long-term financial goals. Investments carry higher
        risks but offer the potential for greater rewards through interest, appreciation, and
        dividends.</p>

    <h3>Tips for Saving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide income: Allocate 50% for essentials, 30% for lifestyle, and 20% for
            debt/savings.
        </li>
        <li>Manage large expenses: Spread costs over time for better affordability.</li>
        <li>Set savings goals: Start small and gradually increase savings.</li>
        <li>Create an emergency fund: Save a small amount from every paycheck and review spending
            habits to cut unnecessary expenses.
        </li>
        <li>Utilize windfalls: Put extra cash like bonuses or tax returns into savings.</li>
    </ul>

            risk.

            associated with investments.
        </li>
    </ul>

            diversification.
