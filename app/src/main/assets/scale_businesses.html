    <h3>Government Support for MSMEs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Philippine government recognizes the importance of Micro, Small, and Medium
            Enterprises (MSMEs) in economic development and has implemented various programs to
            support their growth.
        </li>
        <li>Legislation such as the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises (Republic Act 8289) aims to
            provide assistance to MSMEs through access to financing, capacity-building programs,
            market linkages, and other forms of support.
        </li>
        <li>Initiatives like the Barangay MicroBusiness Enterprises (BMBEs) Act promote economic
            development in rural areas by providing incentives and benefits for small businesses
            with limited assets.
        </li>
