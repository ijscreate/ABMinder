<h2>The Six Most Popular Management Theories for Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Scientific Theory by Frederick W. Taylor</strong></p>
<p>This one is a classic. Taylor's scientific theory poses some fascinating questions by diving
    deeper into the efficiency of work processes. Taylor was an engineer, and he experimented in
    various ways to determine the most efficient and effective ways to get tasks done.</p>
<p>On the surface, this theory held great value. The scientific theory aimed to make work more
    efficient. Unfortunately, the theory had some major flaws as well.</p>
<p>Taylor created four principles of his scientific management theory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each task should be studied to determine the most efficient way to do the task.</li>
    <li>Workers should be matched to jobs that align with both their abilities and motivation.</li>
    <li>Workers should be monitored closely to ensure they only follow best working practices.</li>
    <li>Managers should spend time training employees and planning for future needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few positives of this theory. Maximizing efficiency is a great idea. Assigning
    workers to jobs based on their abilities and motivation levels is also an interesting idea that
    could have beneficial effects in some areas.</p>
<p>Major flaws in the theory include the de-emphasis on teamwork and an incredible focus on specific
    and individualized tasks, eliminating creative problem-solving and making teamwork obsolete. The
    scientific management theory also encourages micromanagement that could drive today's employees
    crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Theory by Henri Fayol</strong></p>
<p>Fayol developed six functions of management that work in conjunction with 14 management
    principles. This theory has a few core ideas that live on today, but you'll rarely find a
    workplace swearing by Fayol's 14 principles.</p>
<p>The six functions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Forecasting</li>
    <li>Planning</li>
    <li>Organizing</li>
    <li>Commanding</li>
    <li>Coordinating</li>
    <li>Controlling</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people combine forecasting and planning into one function, simplifying the theory down to
    five functions. The functions are straightforward, with Fayol saying managers need to plan for
    the future, organize necessary resources, direct employees, work collaboratively, and control
    employees to make sure everyone follows necessary commands.</p>
<p>The 14 principles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Division of work</li>
    <li>Authority</li>
    <li>Discipline</li>
    <li>Unity of command</li>
    <li>Unity of direction</li>
    <li>Subordination of individual interests</li>
    <li>Remuneration</li>
    <li>Centralization</li>
    <li>Scalar chain</li>
    <li>Order</li>
    <li>Equity</li>
    <li>Stability of tenure of personnel</li>
    <li>Initiative</li>
    <li>Esprit de corps</li>
</ul>
<p>There are quality aspects of this theory. Remembering all 14 principles can be challenging and
    makes more sense for a test on management than an entrepreneur running their business, but the
    principles apply in today's workforce. Things like equity and remuneration are important aspects
    of management.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucratic Theory by Max Weber</strong></p>
<p>Weber created the bureaucratic theory, which says an organization will be most efficient if it
    uses a bureaucratic structure. Weber's ideal business uses standard rules and procedures to
    organize itself. He believed this strategy was especially effective for large operations.</p>
<p>The theory includes the following five principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Task specialization</li>
    <li>Hierarchy</li>
    <li>Formal selection</li>
    <li>Rules and requirements</li>
    <li>Impersonal</li>
</ul>
<p>Elements of this theory make sense. Some rules and standards are certainly necessary within every
    organization. On the other hand, it's not easy to implement many of these ideas. The theory and
    practice don't line up. It's almost impossible to keep emotions out of business decisions, and
    sometimes emotions are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Human Relations Theory by Elton Mayo</strong></p>
<p>In stark contrast to Weber's bureaucratic theory of management, the human relations theory
    emphasizes relationships. Mayo believed that productivity increases when people feel like they
    are part of a team and valued by their coworkers.</p>
<p>The human relations theory emphasizes praise and teamwork as motivational factors. While
    emphasizing personal factors is a good idea, there can be too much of a good thing. Valuing
    relationships above all else can lead to tricky situations like office romances and promotions
    based on personality rather than job accomplishments.</p>
<p>A happy medium between the bureaucratic theory and human relations theory might be a better goal
    for managers. Some rules are necessary, but you shouldn't dehumanize employees either.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Theory by Ludwig von Bertalanffy</strong></p>
<p>The systems theory of management believes that each business is a system, much like a living
    organism, with numerous things going on to keep the operation rolling along. A business isn't
    just its CEO, and a person isn't just a brain. A person needs its other organs and other key
    features to live. A business needs more than just a CEO to survive.</p>
<p>While the organism idea is a little extreme, the analogy applies. The systems theory says
    everything needs to work together for a business to succeed.</p>
<p>There is some truth to this theory, as businesses can benefit from getting different departments
    on the same page. If a business's sales team is struggling, it can hurt the whole operation. On
    the other hand, a sales team struggling doesn't necessarily hurt the accounting department. Many
    businesses have separate entities within their organization, so this theory isn't completely
    accurate.</p>
<p><strong>X&Y Theory by Douglas McGregor</strong></p>
<p>The X&Y theory of management assumes there are two different types of workers. Theory X workers
    lack ambition and drive and need to be ordered around by bosses to do anything. Theory Y
    workers, on the other hand, enjoy work and strive for self-fulfillment.</p>
<p>Both views of employees are a bit extreme, as most workers fall somewhere between X and Y.
    Employees don't need to be ordered to do every task, but there is some need for discipline and
    rules for most employees. Many employees do enjoy work, but it doesn't always come naturally and
    requires some encouragement at times. There should be a middle ground for implementing this
    theory.</p>
<p>"This theory is largely considered to be obsolete today, as few managers begin from a starting
    position of being highly polar or binary in terms of their management style being just one of
    two options at opposing ends of a spectrum," said Polly Kay, marketing manager at English
    Blinds.</p>
