    <h2>Social Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>Social entrepreneurship is an approach pursued by individuals or organizations to develop,
        fund, and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. It aims to
        further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals, often linked to poverty
        alleviation, health care, and community development.</p>

    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>An approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies, or entrepreneurs who develop, fund,
        and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>Aims to further broad social, cultural, and environmental goals, often linked to poverty
        alleviation, health care, and community development.</p>

    <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
    <p>Unlike for-profit entrepreneurs who measure success in terms of profit and stock prices,
        social entrepreneurs use different metrics focusing on a positive 'return to society'.</p>

    <h3>Organization Types</h3>
    <p>Can be applied to a wide range of organizations, varying in size, aims, and beliefs,
        including non-profits and hybrid models blending for-profit goals with social
        objectives.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Social entrepreneurship is a growing field, facilitated by the use of the internet and social
        media, enabling social entrepreneurs to reach a larger audience, disseminate information,
        and raise funds through crowdfunding.</p>
    <p>There is no consensus on a common definition of social entrepreneurship, but it involves
        innovative and creative ways to address community problems and create a positive impact on
        society, often combining for-profit goals with generating a positive return to society.</p>
    <p>Social entrepreneurs are passionate about making a difference in the world and use social
        innovation to establish and run enterprises with the aim of solving social problems.</p>

    <h3>How to Become a Social Entrepreneur</h3>
    <p>To become a social entrepreneur, one should identify their passion, research the issue,
        pursue formal education, develop a business plan, build a team, find funding, and launch
        their venture.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>There are many examples of successful social entrepreneurs and social enterprises, such as
        TOMS, Warby Parker, FIGS, Love Your Melon, and Lush. These companies have integrated social
        and environmental goals into their business models and have made a positive impact on
        society while still generating profits.</p>
    <p>TOMS Shoes is a social enterprise founded by Blake Mycoskie in 2006. The company is known for
        its "One for One" business model, where for every pair of shoes sold, TOMS donates a pair to
        a child in need.</p>
    <p>Since its inception, TOMS Shoes has donated over 95 million pairs of shoes to children in
        need in over 70 countries. The company has also expanded its product line to include
        eyewear, coffee, and bags, all with a social mission.</p>
    <p>TOMS Shoes is a prime example of a successful social enterprise that combines business acumen
        with a deep passion for social impact. The company's "One for One" model has inspired other
        businesses to adopt similar models and has created a ripple effect of positive change in the
        world.</p>
