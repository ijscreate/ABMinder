    <h2>Sole Proprietorship</h2>
</header>
<main>
    <article>
        <p>A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader or a proprietorship, is an
            unincorporated business that is owned and run by one individual. It is the simplest form
            of business organization to start and maintain. The owner of a sole proprietorship has
            complete control over the business, and there is no legal distinction between the owner
            and the business entity. The owner is personally responsible for all debts and
            liabilities incurred by the business, and any profits or losses are taxed as personal
            income.</p>

                in a variety of industries.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advantages of Sole Proprietorship</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of establishment: Starting a sole proprietorship is relatively easy and does
                not require any legal formalities. The owner simply needs to register the business
                name and obtain a tax identification number.
            </li>
            <li>Owners have all the profits for themselves: In a sole proprietorship, all the
                profits generated by the business belong to the owner. This can be an advantage if
                the owner wants to keep all the profits for himself or herself.
            </li>
            <li>SSimple taxation: The profits of a sole proprietorship are considered the income of
                the owner. The owner needs only to declare the income of the business in his or her
                tax return and it will be taxed accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>Flexibility to make decisions and change direction quickly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorship</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlimited liability: The owner of a sole proprietorship is personally liable for all
                the debts incurred by the business. This means that creditors, customers, the
                government, and other outside parties can go after the personal assets of the owner
                even after extinguishing all the assets of the business in the satisfaction of their
                claims.
            </li>
            <li>Difficulty of raising additional capital: As the owner of a sole proprietorship, the
                owner is the only person that can provide additional capital. This can be a problem
                if the owner does not have enough resources to use as capital.
            </li>
            <li>Business may be limited in size and scope due to the owner's resources and
                abilities.
            </li>
            <li>Owner's bias: The owner of a sole proprietorship always has the final word in making
                decisions for the business. This can be detrimental to the business if the owner's
                bias prevails and he or she does not make rational decisions.
            </li>
            <li>Heavy workload: The workload of a sole proprietor is also much heavier than the
                owners of other forms of business organizations.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Steps to Create a Sole Proprietorship in the Philippines</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Business registration:</strong> Register your business name with the
                    Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). You can do this by submitting a
                    Certificate of Registration and a valid ID.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tax identification number (TIN):</strong> Obtain a TIN from the Bureau
                    of Internal Revenue (BIR). This number will be used to identify your business
                    for tax purposes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Business permits:</strong> Obtain the necessary permits and licenses
                    from the appropriate government agencies. These may include a Mayor's Permit, a
                    Barangay Clearance, and a Business Permit from the Department of Environment and
                    Natural Resources (DENR).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Business address:</strong> Choose a location for your business and
                    register it with the local government unit (LGU). This will provide you with a
                    physical address for your business.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bank account:</strong> Open a separate bank account for your business.
                    This account will be used to deposit the profits from your business and to pay
                    for any business expenses.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Business operations:</strong> Start your business by offering your
                    products or services. You will be responsible for all aspects of your business,

                </li>
                <li><strong>Recordkeeping:</strong> Maintain accurate records of your business
                    transactions, such as sales receipts, invoices, and expenses. These records will
                    be used to calculate your business's income and profits for tax purposes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tax compliance:</strong> File your business's income tax returns with
                    the BIR. This will include reporting your business's income and profits, as well
                    as any expenses related to your business.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Example of a Sole Proprietorship</h3>
            <p><strong>Establishment:</strong> Jane Doe, a graphic designer, decides to start her
                own business. She registers her business name, "Jane's Designs," and obtains a tax

            <p><strong>Operations:</strong> Jane operates her business by herself. She designs and
                sells various graphic design products, such as posters, t-shirts, and business
                cards. She also handles the marketing and sales of her products.</p>
            <p><strong>Profits:</strong> Jane earns profits from the sales of her products. She can
                choose to reinvest these profits into her business or use them for personal
                purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Liability:</strong> Jane is personally liable for all the debts incurred by
                her business. This means that if Jane's Designs incurs any debts, such as unpaid
                bills or taxes, Jane will be responsible for paying them off.</p>
            <p><strong>Capital:</strong> Jane provides all the capital needed for her business. She

                of her business. She handles everything from designing products to marketing and
