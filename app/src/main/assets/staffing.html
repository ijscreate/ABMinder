<h3>Staffing - As Part of Human Resource Management (HRM)</h3>

<p>Human Resource, 'the people working in the organization' is the most important asset for an
    organization. It is the competence and performance of human resources which helps an
    organization to achieve its goals. To ensure that the positions in the organizational structure
    remain filled with qualified people, staffing as a function of management recruits, selects,
    trains, and motivates people working in the organization.</p>

<p>In organizations with a small number of employees, it is possible for a manager to perform all
    functions related to staffing single-handedly. However, with the increase in the scale of
    operations and the number of employees, it becomes difficult for a manager to manage all aspects
    of human relations. Therefore, organizations with a large number of employees create a separate
    department called the Human Resource Department.</p>

<p>This department, like any other department of the organization, is managed by people with
    expertise in each function of staffing. The Human Resource Department evolved as a result of
    changes in the business environment. The Industrial Revolution and the introduction of the
    factory system led to the employment of thousands of people under one roof. It required
    management to assign the responsibility of hiring people which included recruitment, selection,
    and placement of personnel.</p>
