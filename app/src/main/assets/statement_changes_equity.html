    <h2>Statement of Changes in Equity</h2>
    <p>A statement of changes in equity, also known as a statement of changes in owner's equity or a
        statement of changes in shareholders' equity, is a financial statement that summarizes the
        changes in a company's equity over a reporting period.</p>
    <p>The statement starts with the beginning equity balance and then adds or subtracts items such
        as profits, dividend payments, proceeds from the sale of stock, treasury stock purchases,
        gains and losses recognized directly in equity, effects of changes due to errors in prior
        periods, and effects of changes in fair value for certain assets to arrive at the ending
        equity balance.</p>
    <p>The transactions most likely to appear on this statement include net profit or loss, dividend
        payments, proceeds from the sale of stock, treasury stock purchases, gains and losses
        recognized directly in equity, effects of changes due to errors in prior periods, and
        effects of changes in fair value for certain assets. </p>
    <p>
        The statement of changes in equity is most commonly presented as a separate statement, but
        can also be added to another financial statement. It is also possible to provide a greatly
        expanded version of the statement that discloses the various elements of equity, such as the
        par value of common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, and treasury
        stock, with all of these elements then rolling up into the ending equity total.</p>
    <p>To prepare the statement, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create separate accounts in the general ledger for each type of equity.</li>
        <li>Transfer every transaction within each equity account to a spreadsheet and identify it
            in the spreadsheet.
        </li>
        <li>Aggregate the transactions within the spreadsheet into similar types and transfer them
            to separate line items in the statement of changes in equity.
        </li>
        <li>Complete the statement and verify that the beginning and ending balances in it match the
            general ledger, and that the aggregated line items within it add up to the ending
            balances for all columns.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>To illustrate the concept, let's consider a hypothetical company based in the Philippines,
        XYZ Corporation, for the financial year ended December 31, 2023:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Component of Equity</th>
            <th>Beginning Balance</th>

        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>This statement of changes in equity provides a clear picture of how the company's equity has
        changed over the year, highlighting the effects of profit or loss, dividends, and share
        transactions. It is a crucial tool for management and investors to assess the company's
        financial health and strategic decisions.</p>
