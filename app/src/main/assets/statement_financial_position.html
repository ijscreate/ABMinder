<h2>Statement of Financial Position</h2>
<p>The Statement of Financial Position (SFP) is a financial statement that provides an overview of a
    company's financial condition as of a specific date. It is also known as a balance sheet and is
    composed of three main elements: assets, liabilities, and capital.</p>
<p>Assets are resources owned by the company that have value, such as cash, equipment, and property.
    Liabilities are debts or obligations that the company owes to others, such as accounts payable
    and notes payable. Capital refers to the investment or equity of the owner in the business.</p>
<p>The SFP is important for the owner of a business because it provides a snapshot of the company's
    financial health. It shows the value of the company's assets, the amount of its liabilities, and
    the balance of the owner's interest in the business. This information is useful for making
    informed decisions about the company's operations and future direction.</p>
<p>Assets on the SFP are classified as either current or non-current. Current assets are those that
    are expected to be converted to cash or used up within one year or less. Examples of current
    assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Non-current assets are those that are
    not expected to be converted to cash or used up within one year. Examples of non-current assets
    include property, plant, and equipment.</p>
<p>Liabilities on the SFP are also classified as either current or non-current. Current liabilities
    are those that are due within one year or less. Examples of current liabilities include accounts
    payable and notes payable. Non-current liabilities are those that are due after one year.
    Examples of non-current liabilities include long-term borrowings and deferred tax
    liabilities.</p>
<p>Capital on the SFP is the residual interest in the assets of the business after all liabilities
    have been paid. It represents the owner's investment or equity in the business. Capital can be
    increased through the injection of new funds or through the retention of profits. It can be
    decreased through the payment of dividends or the repayment of loans.</p>
<p>The SFP is prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, which means that it includes all
    transactions that have occurred during the accounting period, regardless of whether or not cash
    has been exchanged. This allows for a more accurate picture of the company's financial
    position.</p>

    understanding the information presented on the SFP, the owner can make informed decisions about
    the company's operations and future direction.</p>

<p>The statement of financial position provides valuable information to stakeholders, including
    investors, creditors, and management. It allows stakeholders to assess the financial health of
    the company and make informed decisions about investing in or lending to the company. It also
    allows management to make strategic decisions about the allocation of resources and the
    management of risk.</p>
