        <h3>Example: Situation Analysis</h3>
        <p>In the Philippines, a tech startup conducts a situation analysis to assess its market
            position and competitive landscape before launching a new mobile app. By examining
            internal factors like technological capabilities, team expertise, and financial
            resources, as well as external factors such as market trends, consumer preferences, and
            regulatory environment, the startup gains valuable insights.</p>
        <p>Through the situation analysis, the startup identifies a growing demand for mobile
            solutions in the Philippines, particularly in the e-commerce and digital payment
            sectors. They also recognize the presence of established competitors offering similar
            apps but lacking certain features that customers desire.</p>
        <p>Armed with this information, the startup refines its marketing strategy to emphasize the
            unique features and benefits of its app, targeting tech-savvy consumers seeking
            convenience and security in mobile transactions. By leveraging the insights from the
            situation analysis, the startup can tailor its messaging, pricing, and promotional
            efforts to effectively position the app in the competitive Philippine market and drive
            user adoption and engagement.</p>
