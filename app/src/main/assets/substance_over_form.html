<h2>Substance Over Form</h2>

<p>In accounting, the substance over form concept is an important principle that ensures financial
    statements provide relevant and reliable information about an entity's economic activities.</p>

<h3>What is Substance Over Form?</h3>
<p>The substance over form principle requires that the economic reality of transactions and events
    should be recorded in the financial statements, rather than just their legal form.</p>

<p>This means that transactions and events should be accounted for and presented in accordance with
    their economic substance, rather than solely based on their legal form.</p>

<h3>Example of Substance Over Form</h3>
<p>For example, consider a lease agreement that is structured in such a way that it appears as an
    operating lease on the surface. However, upon closer examination, it is found that the lease
    agreement effectively transfers all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, making it
    more akin to a finance lease.</p>

<p>According to the substance over form principle, this lease should be accounted for as a finance
    lease, even though it may be legally classified as an operating lease based on the terms of the
    agreement.</p>

<h3>Importance of Substance Over Form</h3>
<p>The substance over form principle is important because it ensures that financial statements
    provide a true and fair view of an entity's financial position, performance, and cash flows.</p>

<p>By focusing on the economic substance of transactions and events, rather than their legal form,
    the principle helps to prevent financial statement manipulation and provides users with relevant
    and reliable information for decision-making purposes.</p>

<p>The substance over form principle is a fundamental concept in accounting that
    emphasizes the importance of recording and presenting transactions and events based on their
    economic reality, rather than their legal form.</p>
