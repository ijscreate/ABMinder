    <h2>SWOT Analysis Overview</h2>

    <p>SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses,
        Opportunities, and Threats of an organization or a project. It is a widely used method to
        analyze the internal and external factors that can impact a business, project, or
        venture.</p>

    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SWOT analysis evaluates internal (Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (Opportunities
            and Threats) factors.
        </li>
        <li>Strengths and Weaknesses are internal factors, while Opportunities and Threats are
            external factors.
        </li>
        <li>By analyzing these factors, businesses can identify their competitive advantage,
            potential areas for improvement, and strategies to capitalize on opportunities or
            mitigate threats.
        </li>
        <li>SWOT analysis is often presented in a 4-boxes layout, with each quadrant representing
            one of the four factors.
        </li>
        <li>To conduct a SWOT analysis, gather a team of experts from different departments and use
            collaborative brainstorming.
        </li>
        <li>Tools like Creately, Visual Paradigm, or Lucidspark can be used to create SWOT analysis
            models and list out information in bullet points.
        </li>
        <li>During brainstorming, add ideas to the relevant quadrant of the grid and highlight
            important or urgent ones.
        </li>
        <li>Use comments to leave feedback and discuss factors further.</li>
        <li>Once ideas are gathered, prioritize them using an impact/effort matrix and plan out next
            steps in a Creately action plan template.
        </li>
    </ul>
