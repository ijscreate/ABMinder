    <b>Key Concepts:</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Introduction:</b> The Time Value of Money (TVM) concept recognizes that a sum of money has different values at different points in time.
    <br><br>
    <b>Formula:</b> The basic formula for TVM is FV = PV * (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
    <br><br>
    <b>Discounting:</b> TVM includes discounting future values to find their present value. The formula for present value is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n.
    <br><br>
    <b>Applications:</b> TVM is crucial in various financial calculations, including loans, investments, and retirement planning.
