    <h2>Factors Influencing Trade and Capital Movement in the Philippines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Economic Policies</h3>
            <p>The Philippine government's strategic economic policies play a pivotal role in
                shaping the landscape for trade and capital movement. Initiatives such as the
                Amendments to the Public Service Act (PSA), Retail Trade Liberalization Act (RTLA),
                and amendments to the Foreign Investment Act (FIA) have not only attracted foreign
                investments but have also fostered a more conducive environment for business
                growth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Trade Agreements</h3>
            <p>The Philippines' active participation in various trade agreements, including the
                Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the World Trade Organization
                (WTO), has significantly enhanced its trade relations with other member nations.
                Bilateral trade agreements with key partners like Japan and the United States have
                further bolstered the country's position in the global market, fostering increased
                trade activities and economic cooperation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Capital Flows</h3>
            <p>The influx and outflow of capital in the Philippines are influenced by a myriad of
                factors, with notable trends observed in recent years. The surge in capital inflows
                during the early 2000s, driven by robust economic growth and remittances from
                overseas Filipino workers, underscores the country's attractiveness to foreign
                investors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Economic Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>The strong economic fundamentals underpinning the Philippine economy, including a
                favorable current account balance and substantial remittances from overseas workers,
                have been instrumental in driving economic growth. These fundamentals not only
                support the stability of the economy but also influence key indicators such as stock
                market performance and exchange rate dynamics.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
            <p>While progress has been made in attracting foreign investments and enhancing trade
                facilitation, challenges persist in managing capital flows and improving the overall
                business environment. Regulatory uncertainties, judicial inefficiencies,
                inconsistent application of laws by Local Government Units (LGUs), and corruption
                pose significant hurdles to business operations and foreign investment
                attraction.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The intricate interplay of economic policies, market dynamics, and global conditions
        underscores the complexity of trade and capital movement in the Philippines, highlighting
        both the progress made and the areas where further development is needed to harness the
        country's full economic potential.</p>
