    <h2>Transactions Not Affecting Cash</h2>
    <p>At times, companies engage in investing and financing transactions that do not involve cash,
        such as issuing common stock to purchase land.</p>
    <p>These transactions do not have an immediate impact on the company's cash balance, but they
        are still significant for the company's financial position and future cash flows.</p>
    <h3>Examples of Transactions not Affecting Cash:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Issuing common stock to purchase land:</strong> In this scenario, the company
            acquires land by issuing shares of its stock instead of using cash. This transaction
            increases the company's equity and assets but does not affect the cash balance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bartering goods or services:</strong> Companies may exchange goods or services
            without involving cash. This type of transaction affects the company's assets or
            liabilities but does not change the cash balance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Reporting and Recording:</h3>
    <p>These transactions are not reported on the statement of cash flows because they do not
        provide or use cash. Instead, they are reported in a separate section or note that is
        presented after the ending cash balance. This allows investors and stakeholders to
        understand the company's financial position better, including its cash flows and non-cash
        transactions.</p>
    <p>When recording these transactions in accounting systems, it is essential to track them
        separately from cash transactions. This ensures that financial statements accurately reflect
        the company's financial position and cash flows. By understanding and properly accounting
        for transactions not affecting cash, companies can make more informed financial decisions
        and provide transparent financial reporting.</p>
