<h3>Types of Organization</h3>

<p>As you might have guessed by now, there exist two types of organization:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Formal Organization</li>
    <li>Informal Organization</li>
</ul>

<h4>Formal Organization</h4>
<p>In every enterprise, there are certain rules and procedures that establish work relationships
    among the employees. These facilitate the smooth functioning of the enterprise. Further, they
    introduce a systematic flow of interactions among the employees. Effectively, all of this is
    done through a formal organization.</p>
<p>Notably, the management is responsible for designing the formal organization in such a way that
    it specifies a clear boundary of authority and responsibility. Coupled with systematic
    coordination among various activities, it ensures the achievement of organizational goals.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The formal organization clearly outlines the relationships among employees, making it easier
        to track responsibilities.
    </li>
    <li>An established chain of commands maintains the unity of command.</li>
    <li>Clear definition of rules and procedures minimizes ambiguity and confusion in individual
        roles, eliminating duplication of efforts.
    </li>
    <li>Stability and predictability in behavior and relationships among members lead to stability
        in the enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>Leads to the achievement of organizational goals and objectives through systematic work
        cultures and relationships.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Decision-making is slow due to the need to flow through the respective chain of commands.
    </li>
    <li>Rigid nature may lead to low recognition of talent and limited adaptability to change.</li>
    <li>Does not fully consider the social nature of humans, focusing primarily on structure and
        work, potentially leading to dissatisfaction among employees.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Informal Organization</h4>
<p>Unlike formal organization, informal organization is fluid and there are no written or predefined
    rules for it. Essentially, it is a complex web of social relationships among members that are
    born spontaneously. Unlike the formal organization, it cannot be forced or controlled by
    management.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Communication does not need to follow the defined chain, resulting in faster
        communication.
    </li>
    <li>Facilitates socialization within the enterprise, leading to a sense of belongingness and job
        satisfaction.
    </li>
    <li>Allows for true feedback and reactions, covering up various limitations of formal
        organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Random nature can result in the spread of rumors and chaos within the enterprise.</li>
    <li>Difficulty in effecting changes and growth without the support of the informal organization,
        which can work for or against the enterprise.
    </li>
    <li>Conforms to group standards and behaviors, which, if against organizational interests, can
        lead to disruption.
    </li>
</ul>
