<h2>Value of Customers</h2>
<p>All marketing efforts focus on how to create, deliver, and communicate value to the customers. In
    this section, you’ll learn why customers play such an important role in a business’s marketing
    activities.</p>
<p>Marketing exists to help organizations understand, reach, and deliver value to their customers.
    For this reason, the customer is considered the cornerstone of marketing and the foundation of
    any business' success. One of the primary goals of any marketing strategy should be to identify
    and meet the needs of the consumer. Considering customer importance at all stages of the
    marketing process helps build customer satisfaction and increase its long-term goal of repeat
    business.</p>
<p>Considering customer needs during the development and promotion of a product is not the only way
    to emphasize customer needs. Customer considerations after the product has been marketed are
    important as well. Customer service and interaction with the consumer after the product has been
    sold, not only build strong relationships with the consumer but offer companies valuable
    information that will help to design more effective marketing efforts in the future.</p>
<p>With this in mind, what is likely to happen when an organization doesn’t understand or pay
    attention to the customer’s wants?</p>
<p>One of the world’s best-known brands, Coca-Cola, provides a high-profile example of
    misunderstanding customer “wants.” In an interview, Roberto Goizueta, who was the chairman,
    director, and chief executive officer of the Coca-Cola Company from August 1980 until his death
    in October 1997, recounts the disastrous launch of “New Coke” in 1985 and describes the hard
    lessons they learned when they changed the original taste of Coke. The “New Coke” mission is to
    increase Coca Cola’s market share against Pepsi and 7 up. However, it created a backlash from
    lifelong customers, which forced the executives to revert the original recipe and replace the
    “New Coke” with “Coke Classic”. To know more about Goizueta’s interview, you may watch the video
    on this youtube link. <a href="https://youtu.be/BmQs8g9ytRA">https://youtu.be/BmQs8g9ytRA</a>

<h3>Marketing Considerations</h3>
<p>Some of the considerations to take into account when marketing to your customers are honesty,
    integrity, and clarity. Keeping what the consumer needs in mind is an integral part of effective
    marketing. Dishonest advertising campaigns can generate quick sales, but those sales will falter
    as consumers realize they have been duped. Selling a good product marketed with integrity is the
    standard. To do this, a company needs to build the customer’s confidence in its product over
    time, which will keep them coming back and ensures long-term success in the future.</p>

<h3>Word-of-Mouth</h3>
<p>Underestimating the power of customer’s word-of-mouth is detrimental to your success. Consumers
    like to talk, whether they are talking about a product they enjoyed or a product that left them
    wanting for more. Word-of-mouth has a snowball effect, particularly in an age when you can
    quickly message anyone you know across the globe using your phone. On the other side of the
    coin, your company can't afford to not consider how quickly its product and reputation can be
    severely affected by negative reviews. This is why marketing a product honestly and with
    integrity is important.</p>

<h3>The Customer Is Always Right</h3>
<p>"The customer is always right" is a motto that exhorts the service staff to give a high priority
    to customer satisfaction. It was popularized by successful retailers such as Harry Gordon
    Selfridge, John Wanamaker, and Marshall Field. These men learned early in their careers that the
    success of their stores depended on the happiness of their customers. They advocated that
    customer complaints should be treated seriously so that customers do not feel cheated or
    deceived.</p>
<p>Saying “the customer is always right” can be difficult when a customer has an issue with your
    organization and truly believes they are “right”. In this situation, they may possibly be making
    demands that are impossible for you to meet. So, what’s the best way to handle these
    situations?</p>
<p>A key point to keep in mind is that the customer is always right, in their own mind, although not
    necessarily in reality. At this stage, it’s critical not to disagree with the customer because
    that makes them angry and more argumentative. Here are some key points you may want to
    consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Don’t focus on the negative.</li>
    <li>Don’t even say the word, “no.” If you are in a situation where you need to say “no” to a
        customer, make sure to provide an alternative option for them.
    </li>
    <li>Don’t waste time focusing on who’s right or wrong in a situation. Instead, focus on the
        positive—on what you can do to help the customer.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Reasons Why the Customer is Always Right</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Customers Makes the Business. One reason many businesses still follow “customer is
        always right” standard is that they know how important their customers are in the long- term
        success of the business. A business without customers is just a group of people pitching a
        product to deaf ears. As a business, you want your customers to return as well as feel
        welcomed and appreciated at the same time. Many businesses lose sight of this fact when they
        become successful, not realizing that they can still lose everything without the love and
        loyalty of their customers.
    </li>
    <li>The Backlash Could Be Devastating. The effect of displeasing just one customer can be
        devastating to any business. Just one “detailed complaint” on social media can have a
        negative effect on the business’ reputation. This is also true whether you are just a
        starting company or an established enterprise. When it comes to startups, it’s possible that
        they may not be able to recover from this damage because new customers depend on positive
        reviews before trying out a new product or service. Things like this can negatively affect
        any business in the long run even with the help of a reputation management company.
    </li>
    <li>It’s Good Business Ethics. Business ethics is a group of morally correct actions that
        further a business’ reputation by treating customers and associates as human beings.
        Business ethics classes teach that all departments within a business establishment should
        have a uniform code of conduct. This code of conduct should display the heart of the
        business, which should include love and loyalty to their customers.
    </li>
    <li>It is set as the Standard of Customer Service Excellence. “The customer is always right”
        also sets a standard for the customer service department that strives for excellence.
        Customer service experiences are one of the leading causes of customer loyalty and customer
        loss. Every customer matters. Therefore, businesses should strive to create an environment
        of consistent extra-mile service. It is essential that you are communicating effectively so
        that you and your customers can find the best possible solution to any issue.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Types of Customers</h3>
<p>Customers play the most significant part in business. In fact, the customer is the actual boss in
    a deal and is responsible for the profit for the organization. Customer is the one who uses the
    products and services and judges the quality of those products and services. Hence, it’s
    important for an organization to retain customers or make new customers. To manage customers,
    organizations should follow some sort of approaches like segmentation or division of customers
    into groups because each customer has to be considered valuable and profitable.</p>
<p>Customers can be of the following types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Loyal Customers:</strong> These types of customers promote more sales compared to
        other customers. Even though they are less in numbers, these customers are the ones who are
        completely satisfied with the business’ products and services. They revisit the organization
        over time; hence, it is crucial to interact and keep in touch with them regularly. Loyal
        customers want individual attention and demand respectful responses from suppliers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Discount Customers:</strong> Discount customers are also frequent visitors but they
        are only a part of business when offered with discounts on regular products and brands. The
        more is the discount, the more they gravitate towards buying. Focusing on these types of
        customers is also important as they also generate profits in the business.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Impulsive Customers:</strong> These types of customers don’t have any specific items
        on their product list but impulsively buy what they find good or important at that moment.
        Handling these customers is a challenge as they are not particularly looking for a specific
        product. They want the supplier to display all the useful products they have so that they
        can buy whatever they like. If impulsive customers are treated accordingly, there is a high
        probability that these customers could generate more sales for the business.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Need Based Customers:</strong> These customers are product specific and only tend to
        buy items that solve their specific need. These customers should be handled positively by
        showing them ways to buy products which they may need in the future.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wandering Customers:</strong> These are the least profitable customers as sometimes
        they themselves are not sure what to buy. They are usually new customers and most of the
        time visit a store just to compare prices. They tend to review the features of the most
        leading products in the market but usually don’t show interest in buying it. To grab such
        customers, they should be properly informed about the various positive features of the
        products so that they develop a sense of interest.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of Relationship Marketing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cost-effective: Maintaining existing customers through relationship marketing can be highly
        cost-effective, as it is often less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire
        new ones.
    </li>
    <li>Increased customer retention: By connecting with customers and providing them with essential
        information tailored to their individual interests, concerns, pain points, and needs,
        companies can increase customer retention and loyalty.
    </li>
    <li>Improved marketing ROI: With higher customer retention numbers, the costs of customer
        acquisition decrease, providing companies with a higher budget for building and implementing
        their relationship marketing strategy.
    </li>
    <li>Increased sales: Existing customers often return to make more purchases since they already
        value the products or services offered by the company.
    </li>
    <li>Lead to referrals and higher brand awareness: Happy customers are more likely to share their
        positive experiences with others, leading to referrals and increased brand awareness.
    </li>
    <li>Boost above the competition: Relationship marketing can help companies create loyal
        customers who stay with them and persuade others to buy from them, giving them a competitive
        advantage.
    </li>
</ul>
