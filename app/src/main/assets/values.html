<h1>Present Value vs Future Value</h1>
<p>In finance, present value (PV) and future value (FV) are important concepts used to evaluate the
    worth of money at different points in time. Let's understand each concept:</p>
<h2>Present Value (PV)</h2>
<p>Present value represents the current value of a future sum of money or cash flow, discounted at a
    specific rate of return. It answers the question: "What is the value today of a future amount of
    money?"</p>
<ul>
    <li>PV is calculated using the formula: <strong>PV = FV / (1 + r)^n</strong>, where
        <strong>FV</strong> is the future value, <strong>r</strong> is the discount rate, and
        <strong>n</strong> is the number of periods.
    </li>
    <li>A lower discount rate results in a higher present value, while a higher discount rate
        results in a lower present value.
    </li>
    <li>Present value helps in decision-making by determining the current worth of future cash
        flows, investments, or liabilities.
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
    <p>Let's say you are considering an investment that will require an initial investment of PHP
        50,000 and is expected to generate cash flows of PHP 15,000 per year for the next three
        years. You want to know if the investment is worth making, so you decide to calculate the
        present value of the expected cash flows using a discount rate of 10%.</p>
    <p>To calculate the present value of the first cash flow, which will be received in one year,
        you would use the following formula:</p>
    <p>PV = CF / (1 + r)^1</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PV is the present value</li>
        <li>CF is the cash flow (in this case, PHP 15,000)</li>
        <li>r is the discount rate (in this case, 10%, or 0.10 as a decimal)</li>
        <li>n is the number of periods until the cash flow is received (in this case, 1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plugging in the values, you get:</p>
    <p>PV = 15,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = PHP 13,636.36</p>
    <p>To calculate the present value of the second cash flow, which will be received in two years,
        you would use the same formula, but with a different value for n:</p>
    <p>PV = CF / (1 + r)^2</p>
    <p>Plugging in the values, you get:</p>
    <p>PV = 15,000 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = PHP 12,391.41</p>
    <p>To calculate the present value of the third cash flow, which will be received in three years,
        you would use the same formula, but with a different value for n:</p>
    <p>PV = CF / (1 + r)^3</p>
    <p>Plugging in the values, you get:</p>
    <p>PV = 15,000 / (1 + 0.10)^3 = PHP 11,258.94</p>
    <p>To determine the overall present value of the expected cash flows, you would add up the
        present values of the individual cash flows:</p>
    <p>PV = 13,636.36 + 12,391.41 + 11,258.94 = PHP 37,286.71</p>
    <p>Since the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the initial investment of PHP
        50,000, this investment is not expected to generate a profit.</p>
    <p>In summary, in this example, the present value of the expected cash flows is calculated by
        discounting each cash flow back to its present value using a discount rate of 10%. The
        present value of the individual cash flows is then added up to determine the overall present
        value of the expected cash flows. Since the present value is less than the initial
        investment, this investment is not expected to generate a profit.</p>
</div>

<h2>Future Value (FV)</h2>
<p>Future value represents the value of an investment or cash flow at a specific future date, based
    on an assumed rate of return. It answers the question: "What will be the value in the future of
    an investment made today?"</p>
<ul>
    <li>FV is calculated using the formula: <strong>FV = PV * (1 + r)^n</strong>, where
        <strong>PV</strong> is the present value, <strong>r</strong> is the interest rate or rate of
        return, and <strong>n</strong> is the number of periods.
    </li>
    <li>A higher interest rate or rate of return results in a higher future value, while a lower
        interest rate results in a lower future value.
    </li>
    <li>Future value is essential for assessing the growth potential of investments and determining
        the value of savings or investments over time.
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
    <p>Let's say you have PHP 10,000 today and you plan to invest it in a savings account with an
        annual interest rate of 5%. How much would the investment be worth in 5 years?</p>
    <p>To calculate the future value, you can use the formula:</p>
    <p>Future Value = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Years</p>
    <p>In this case, the principal is PHP 10,000, the interest rate is 5% or 0.05, and the number of
        years is 5.</p>
    <p>So, the future value would be:</p>
    <p>Future Value = PHP 10,000 x (1 + 0.05)^5</p>
    <p>Future Value = PHP 10,000 x (1.05)^5</p>
    <p>Future Value = PHP 10,000 x 1.2762815625</p>
    <p>Future Value = PHP 12,762.82</p>
    <p>Therefore, the investment would be worth PHP 12,762.82 in 5 years, assuming a constant
        interest rate of 5%.</p>
</div>

<p>Understanding present value and future value is crucial for making informed financial decisions,
    such as investment planning, budgeting, and evaluating the profitability of projects or business
    ventures.</p>
