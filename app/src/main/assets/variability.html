    <h1>Understanding Variability in Finance</h1>

    <p>Variability is a crucial concept in finance that refers to the extent of changes in financial
        data over time. It is a measure of the degree of dispersion or spread of a set of values. In
        financial markets, understanding variability is essential for assessing risk, making
        investment
        decisions, and implementing risk management strategies.</p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Variability:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Volatility:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Volatility is a common measure of variability,
                    indicating the degree of variation of a trading price series over a specific
                    period.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Higher volatility often implies greater risk and
                    potential for price fluctuations, affecting investment outcomes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Standard deviation quantifies the amount of
                    variation or dispersion of a set of values.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Widely used in finance, standard deviation helps
