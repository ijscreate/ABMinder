<h2>What is Marketing?</h2>
<p>As defined by the American Marketing Association, Marketing is “the activity, set of
    institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings
    that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”</p>

<p>If you read the definition closely, you see that there are four activities, or components, of
    marketing:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creating. The process of collaborating with suppliers and customers to create offerings that
        have value.
    </li>
    <li>Communicating. Describing the offerings and its value to your potential and current
        customers.
    </li>
    <li>Delivering. Getting those offerings to the consumer in a way that optimizes value.</li>
    <li>Exchanging. Trading value for those offerings.</li>
</ol>

<p>The traditional way of viewing the components of marketing is via the four Ps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Product. Goods and services (creating offerings).</li>
    <li>Promotion. Communication.</li>
    <li>Place. Getting the product to a point at which the customer can purchase it (delivering).
    </li>
    <li>Price. The monetary amount charged for the product (exchanging).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Product</h2>
<p>The product you sell can be a physical item or service intangible, such as sending food home or
    service cleaning. When you create your product, you need to consider factors such as the name,
    packaging, different types of uses and safety when used. It is also necessary to determine how
    the product appeals to a specific market segment. The product should meet the needs of a
    particular group of people, such as professionals, housewives, business owners, students, or
    golfers.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>
<p>You need to determine the price of the product. If the price is too high, potential buyers might
    not purchase it. If it is too low, you may have difficulty obtaining profits. You will also have
    to consider the price of the competition.</p>

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>The concept of place refers to the distribution channels; this is where the product will sell and
    how to hit the market.</p>

<h2>Promotion</h2>
<p>Promoting the product or service involves raising awareness among potential customers about its
    existence.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>
<p>Value is the center of everything marketing does.</p>

<h3>Needs</h3>
<p>A human need is something that a person must have in order to live and survive.</p>

<h3>Wants</h3>
<p>A human want is something that a person desires to have. Demands are also humans want to be
    supported by buying power.</p>

<h2>Creating Offerings That Have Value</h2>
<p>Marketing creates those goods and services that the company offers at a price to its customers or
    clients.</p>

<h2>Communicating Offerings</h2>
<p>Communicating is a broad term in marketing that means describing the offering and its value to
    your potential and current customers, as well as learning from customers what it is they want
    and like.</p>

<h2>Delivering Offerings</h2>
<p>Marketing can’t just promise value, it also has to deliver value. Delivering an offering that has
    value is much more than simply getting the product into the hands of the user; it is also making
    sure that the user understands how to get the most out of the product and is taken care of if he
    or she requires service later.</p>

<h2>Exchanging Offerings</h2>
<p>In addition to creating an offering, communicating its benefits to consumers, and delivering the
    offering, there is the actual transaction, or exchange, that has to occur.</p>
