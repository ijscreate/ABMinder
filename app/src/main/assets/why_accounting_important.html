    <h3>Definition of Accounting</h3>
    <p>The American Accounting Association (AAA) defines accounting as "the process of identifying,
        measuring, and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions
        by the users of information." The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
        defines accounting as "the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant
        manner and terms of money, transactions, and events which are in part at least of a
        financial character and interpreting the results thereof."</p>

    <h3>Main Functions of Accounting</h3>
    <div>
        <h3>1. Keeping a Systematic Record of Business Transactions</h3>
        <p>Recording transactions involves not only entering the transactions in the accounting
            books but also organizing them in a systematic manner. This enables easy understanding
            and interpretation of the records by the readers. The records should be organized
            chronologically, by account, or by any other meaningful method. No matter how
            comprehensive the records are, if they are not produced systematically, then they
            provide little to no value.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2. Protecting Properties of the Business</h3>
        <p>The accounting records serve as evidence that properties of a business do exist or how
            much of a particular resource a company has. If the accounting records show that the
            amount of cash should be $1,000,000, any excess or deficiency will be noticed
            immediately. Moreover, the accounting system helps in preventing employee fraud and
            misappropriation of company resources. The accounting system ensures that there is
            proper authorization and approval for transactions, and that they are recorded
            accurately.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>3. Communicating Results to Various Parties in or Connected with the Business</h3>
        <p>Accounting reports are used by external parties (e.g., potential investors, government
            agencies) and also by the management in their decision-making function. Communication of
            the results of operations of a company is essential for all concerned parties to enable
            them to take well-informed decisions. The accounting reports provide information about
            the financial position, performance, and cash flows of a company, which is useful for
            decision-making.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>4. Meeting Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>In many countries, the government requires some companies to provide financial reports
            quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. This procedure aims to protect the public by
            providing them with the necessary information to make sound decisions. The government
            also requires reports from heavily regulated industries such as the energy and oil
            industries. The accounting system ensures that the legal requirements are met, and the
            necessary reports are submitted on time.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>5. Assisting in Planning and Control</h3>
        <p>The accounting system provides information that is useful for planning and controlling
            the operations of a business. The accounting reports provide information about the past
            performance of the business, which can be used to plan for the future. The accounting
            system also helps in controlling the operations of a business by providing information
            about the financial performance of various departments or segments of the business.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>6. Facilitating Economic Decision Making</h3>
        <p>The accounting system provides financial information that is useful for economic
            decision-making. The accounting reports provide information about the financial
            position, performance, and cash flows of a company, which is useful for decision-making.
            The accounting information can be used to evaluate the financial performance of a
            company, compare it with industry averages, and make decisions about investments,
            financing, and dividend policy.</p>
