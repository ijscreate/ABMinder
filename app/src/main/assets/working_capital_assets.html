    <h2>Working Capital</h2>
</header>
<div class="definition">
    <p>Working capital is a measure of a company's liquidity and operational efficiency, calculated
        as the difference between its current assets and current liabilities.</p>
    <p>The formula for working capital is:</p>
    <math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

            <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets}

            </annotation>
        </semantics>
    </math>
    <ul>
        <li>Current Assets: These are resources that a company expects to convert to cash within one
            fiscal year or operating cycle, whichever is longer. Current assets include cash,
            accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses, and other
            liquid assets.
        </li>
        <li>Current Liabilities: These are obligations that a company must pay within one fiscal
            year or operating cycle, whichever is longer. Current liabilities include accounts
            payable, accrued liabilities, short-term debt, and the current portion of long-term
            debt.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A positive working capital indicates that a company has enough assets to cover its short-term
        liabilities, while a negative working capital suggests the opposite. However, the optimal
        level of working capital depends on the industry, the particular company, and its specific
        circumstances. It’s always a good idea to compare a company’s working capital with that of
        other companies in the same industry.</p>
    <p>Working capital is important because it indicates a company's ability to meet its short-term
        financial obligations and fund its day-to-day operations. A positive working capital balance
        indicates that a company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities,
        while a negative working capital balance indicates that a company may have difficulty
        meeting its short-term obligations.</p>
    <h3>Common Uses of Working Capital</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inventory management: Working capital can be used to purchase inventory and raw
            materials, ensuring that a business has enough stock on hand to meet customer demand.
        </li>
        <li>Accounts receivable: Working capital can be used to finance accounts receivable,
            allowing a business to extend credit to customers and improve sales.
        </li>
        <li>Operating expenses: Working capital can be used to cover operating expenses, such as
            salaries, rent, and utilities, ensuring that a business can continue to operate
            smoothly.
        </li>
        <li>Short-term financing: Working capital can be used as a source of short-term financing,
            allowing a business to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, such as purchasing
            equipment or inventory at a discount.
        </li>
        <li>Cash flow management: Working capital can be used to manage cash flow, ensuring that a
            business has enough liquidity to meet its short-term obligations and avoid cash flow
            problems.
        </li>
        <li>Debt management: Working capital can be used to pay down debt, reducing interest
            expenses and improving a business's financial position.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Example of Working Capital Calculation</h3>
        <div class="current-assets">
            <h4>Current Assets:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cash and cash equivalents: PHP 1,500,000</li>
                <li>Accounts receivable: PHP 2,000,000</li>
                <li>Inventory: PHP 5,000,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total current assets: PHP 8,500,000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="current-liabilities">
            <h4>Current Liabilities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accounts payable: PHP 1,000,000</li>
                <li>Accrued expenses: PHP 500,000</li>
                <li>Short-term debt: PHP 2,000,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total current liabilities: PHP 3,500,000</p>
        </div>
        <div class="working-capital">
            <h4>Working Capital Calculation:</h4>
            <p>Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</p>
            <p>Working Capital = PHP 8,500,000 - PHP 3,500,000</p>
            <p>Working Capital = PHP 5,000,000</p>
        </div>
        <p>In this example, the manufacturing company has a working capital of PHP 5,000,000, which
            means it has enough current assets to meet its short-term obligations of PHP 3,500,000
            and still have PHP 1,500,000 left for other operational needs. This is a positive sign
            of the company's financial health, as it indicates that the company can meet its
            short-term obligations and still have enough liquidity to take advantage of growth
            opportunities.</p>
