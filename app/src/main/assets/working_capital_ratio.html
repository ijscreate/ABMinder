    <li><b>Industry Differences:</b> Different industries have varying liquidity requirements, which
        can impact the interpretation of the Working Capital Ratio.
    </li>

    </li>

<b>Example:</b> <br><br> Suppose a company has the following balance sheet data: <br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Current Assets:</b> $500,000</li>
    <li><b>Current Liabilities:</b> $300,000</li>
</ul>
<br><br> Calculating the Working Capital Ratio: <br><br> <i>Working Capital Ratio = $500,000 /
    $300,000 = 1.67</i> <br><br> Based on the Working Capital Ratio, the company has sufficient
current assets to meet its short-term obligations.

<b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br> The Working Capital Ratio is a crucial financial metric for assessing a
company's liquidity and financial health. By evaluating a company's current assets and current
